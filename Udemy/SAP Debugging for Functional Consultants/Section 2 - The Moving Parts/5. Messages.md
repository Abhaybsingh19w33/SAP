# Messages

## Introduction
Messages are probably the most important clues to debugging for functional consultants.

## Example Scenario

### Running a Call Center Report
1. Execute the call center report.
2. The system provides results.
3. If the results are not as expected, the user might complain about incorrect data.
4. This scenario necessitates debugging to determine where the program might be going wrong.

## Debugging Approach

### Understanding Program Flow
1. **Selection Data**: The program retrieves selection data (e.g., company code, selection period, cost center).
2. **Data Processing**: The program processes the data.
3. **Display Output**: The program displays the output.

### Role of Functional Consultants
- Verify if the program is accessing the correct tables and fetching the right data.
- Leave detailed processing logic to ABAP consultants due to its complexity.

## Importance of Messages
- Messages act as a communication tool between the program and the user, indicating whether something is right or wrong.
- Example: If a user enters a dummy company code and receives a message stating "No data selected," it means the program couldn't find any data for the given selection criteria.

## Debugging Using Messages

### Identifying the Message Class and Number
1. Click on the help option when the message is displayed.
2. Note the message class and number (e.g., `RP016`).

### Viewing the Message Class
1. Open transaction `SE91`.
2. Enter the message class and number.
3. Click on display to view the message.

### Using the "Where-Used" Button
1. In `SE91`, click on the "Where-Used" button.
2. Filter the results to focus on the specific program being debugged.
3. Identify the exact lines of code where the message is being triggered.

### Setting Breakpoints
1. Set breakpoints at the lines where the message is being triggered.
2. Execute the program again with the breakpoints set.
3. The debugger will pause the program's execution at the critical points where the message is issued.

## Detailed Example

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Identify the Program**
   - Go to `System > Status`.
   - Copy the program name.

2. **Open the Program in SE38**
   - Open transaction `SE38`.
   - Paste the program name and click display.

3. **Find the Message Class and Number**
   - Click on help when the message is displayed.
   - Note the message class and number (e.g., `RP016`).

4. **View the Message Class in SE91**
   - Open transaction `SE91`.
   - Enter the message class and number.
   - Click on display.

5. **Use the "Where-Used" Button**
   - Click on the "Where-Used" button.
   - Filter the results to focus on the specific program.
   - Identify the lines of code where the message is triggered.

6. **Set Breakpoints**
   - Set breakpoints at the identified lines.
   - Execute the program again.
   - The debugger will pause at the breakpoints.

## Conclusion
- Messages provide a starting point for debugging large chunks of code.
- They allow consultants to focus on specific areas rather than going through the entire code line by line.
- Functional consultants can use messages to dive directly into the code at the points where issues are occurring.





The provided text emphasizes the importance of messages in debugging for functional consultants in SAP. Messages serve as crucial clues that help identify where issues might be occurring within a program. The text uses an example of a call center report to illustrate this point. When the report is executed, the system provides results, but if the results are not as expected, the user might complain about incorrect data. This scenario necessitates debugging to determine where the program might be going wrong.

Programs can indeed have errors since they are written by humans. Functional consultants can play a significant role in debugging by verifying if the program is functioning correctly. Typically, a program performs two main tasks: it retrieves selection data (such as company code, selection period, and cost center) and then processes this data to display the output. Functional consultants can check if the program is accessing the correct tables and fetching the right data. However, the detailed processing logic is usually left to ABAP consultants due to its complexity.

Messages in SAP act as a communication tool between the program and the user, indicating whether something is right or wrong. For instance, if a user enters a dummy company code and receives a message stating "No data selected," it means the program couldn't find any data for the given selection criteria. If the user believes they have entered the correct data but still receives this message, it indicates a potential issue that needs debugging.

To debug using messages, the functional consultant can start by identifying the message class and message number associated with the error. This information can be found by clicking on the help option when the message is displayed. The message class and number uniquely identify the message within the program. The consultant can then use transaction SE91 to view the message class and number.

Next, the consultant can use the "Where-Used" button in SE91 to find all instances where this message is used in the program. By filtering the results to focus on the specific program being debugged, the consultant can identify the exact lines of code where the message is being triggered. Setting breakpoints at these lines allows the consultant to pause the program's execution at the critical points where the message is issued.

By executing the program again with the breakpoints set, the consultant can dive directly into the code at the points where the message is triggered. This approach helps pinpoint the exact location and context of the issue, making it easier to understand what went wrong. The text concludes by highlighting that messages provide a starting point for debugging large chunks of code, allowing consultants to focus on specific areas rather than going through the entire code line by line.



Messages are probably the most important clues to debugging for functional consultants.

Let's see an example.

So if you take our call center report said cost.

And then execute the program.

The system gives you some results.

See, for example, the results that you see here are not what are being expected.

Did the user complains that something is wrong with the data?

And you want to find out where exactly things went wrong?

Wait a minute, programs can go wrong.

Yeah, programs can go Damron.

After all, it's a human that writes the program, isn't it?

And that's one of the reasons why we are learning debugging here.

Programs can go wrong and be as functional, consultants can do our own part in debugging.

So you want to find out the program is doing the right thing or not?

So how do you know?

So a program typically does two things.

Step number one.

Get the selection data in the case of our report.

This is our selection data company called Selection Period Call Center, so on and so forth.

Go to the correct tables.

The database tables, which data processed data and finally.

Display output typically in most reports.

This is how the program runs at a very high level.

So as a functional consultant, what can you do?

Well.

We know what the selection criteria is, nothing that we can do there, go to the tables so we can check

whether the report is going to the right tables.

So this is one area that we can go cross very fine and then.

We can find out if it is fetching the right data.

It's not just enough that it goes to the correct tables, it should go and fetch the right data.

We can cross-check that.

And then after that, it processes the data and displays output.

Well, there is some bit of debugging that you can do here, but I would leave this part.

About consultors, because there is so much of logic that can go on inside.

You really don't want to go there.

Just leave that part to the ABAB consultant.

But these are two areas that you, as functional consultant would understand very well.

And can help with Deben now coming back to our messages, what is the role of a message here?

As a function consultant, we typically tend to view a report or a program like this.

That is an input.

And there is an open.

Program runs, takes the input and creates an output.

So as a function of consultant, input and output are the only things that, you know, you don't know

what's happening behind the scenes.

But you know the logic.

You know, the logic that should have run when this program executes.

You just don't know how it's being done.

Meaning the call and the intention is to not understand the entire program either.

We don't want to do that.

If we do it, we become about consultants.

However.

When you see a message.

For example.

You're expecting some data.

I just entered some dummy company court and I see this message.

No data selected when you see your message.

It's a way in which the program is communicating to you, saying something is right or something is

wrong or this is what has happened.

In this case, Jessy's I can't seem to find any data for the options you've selected.

Well, in this case, I'm OK because I just selected a dummy company called nine nine nine nine.

Obviously, there's no data.

But for some reason, if you think that.

You know, you have entered everything right, so the company called Right period, right, cost center,

right and executed and still as a piece shows you that message, then something is wrong.

You have to go debug the program.

And I'm seeing messages or good clues for you as a function consultant to dive into the program precisely

to the point where you want to see something.

So the court behind the scenes is like a big machine, you don't want to see how the entire machine

works, but you just want to go to the exact point where you think that things are breaking.

And then maybe check for certain things and then quickly go back.

So a message gives you a starting point to search for what went wrong.

For example, what's a program that's running this call center report?

Gurel system.

Status.

Copy this, open another window, see 38.

And.

Pace this program and click display.

What it does is it opens the source code for this program.

So this source code over here, hundreds or however many number of lines are called.

Is the big machine that I was talking about.

I don't want to go line by line, step by step, year by year until I see a point where things might

have broken.

Instead, the messages that we see on the screen are quick clues or starting points for us to dive into

the program precisely to the point where things are breaking or we think of breaking.

In this case, we are going to jump right to the point where this message is being issued.

With the hope that we're going to find out something over there that might have gone wrong that results

in this message.

So how do you do that?

How do you dive in?

Well, we know the error message here.

So step number one is click on help.

We want to find out what is the message class behind this little display.

Because sometimes it's a message, sometimes it's a pop up, sometimes it's an error irrespective.

The goal is to find out the message class and the message number, which uniquely identifies a message.

We'll see what it is, so click on help.

And.

This is the message no or B 016.

Most messages will have this kind of a format, two plus three.

The first two characters is the message class, the last three characters, the numbers is a no message

no.

So making a mental note of it and then we're going to go open that message glass.

R.P. 016.

I said, OK, step number two is to go to S.

E 91.

Which is a transaction to view a message glass.

And then type in Arpit.

That's a message class and the message number is 016 and Click Display.

This is the message class a number that was used to throw that message that we saw when we ran the call

center report.

Now, step number three is to use this button.

This button is called the wear used button.

It's a pretty useful button for function consultants when you want to find out and dig through where

things are.

Let me show you how you click on that button.

And they just programmed nothing else.

Click OK, SFP shows you a list of 111 lines of programs, different programs, in fact, 111 such programs

where this message is being thrown.

But why do we care about all these programs, we only care about one program, the call center program.

This message could be used in number of places we don't care.

We want to debunk our call center report.

To go to search and then enter the name of the program, go to system.

Status and their Visio program.

So enter the name of the program and click, OK?

So this is our program, and if you double click it.

You'll see all the places in the program where the message is being thrown.

Simple enough, right?

So DoubleClick, the first line.

And it takes you right to the line where that message is being thrown.

So go put a break point there.

Go back and double click on the second line.

Again, you go exactly to the line where that message is being thrown.

And put a great point that.

Go back.

We are done with this screen.

So what we have done essentially is to take that message glass, go to its definition and click on various.

When you did that, we give you a list of programs where this message is being thrown and that we have

filtered out all the other results and focused on the program that we want to be debunk.

And then Sabiha shown us precisely the lines where the message is being thrown.

It could be one or two different places.

Put a break point in all of them.

Come back.

Now execute the program cost.

You see, Sappi has stopped the program, right, put a breakpoint.

Now, we have taken a nosedive into the cord right to the point where the message is being thrown.

What do we do now?

Now, what we do at this point is something we are going to discuss in the next chapter.

But for now, what I want you guys to understand is messages or clues are starting points for you to

debug large chunks of code.

Instead of going line by line through these large chunks of code, you can go precisely to the point

where you think something wrong is happening and then he can go about debugging a little bit before

a little bit after.

What we do next is something that we're going to.
