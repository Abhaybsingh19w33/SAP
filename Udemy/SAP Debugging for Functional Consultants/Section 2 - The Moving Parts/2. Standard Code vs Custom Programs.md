# Standard Code vs Custom Programs

## Introduction
The provided text explains the process of debugging standard programs versus custom programs in SAP, specifically focusing on creating and troubleshooting sales orders.

## Scenario Overview

### Step 1: Creating a Sales Order with Standard Customer
1. Navigate to SAP system: `Logistics > Sales and Distribution > Sales Order > Sales Order`.
2. Enter order type or sales org: `1000`.
3. Enter customer: `1000`.
4. Enter material: `M01` with quantity `1`.
5. Save the transaction.
6. Go back to change or display mode.
7. Issue an output: Select `BA00` and click on `Print Preview`.
8. Print preview is displayed successfully.

### Step 2: Creating a Sales Order with New Customer
1. Create a new customer (e.g., `6790`).
2. Navigate to SAP system: `Logistics > Sales and Distribution > Sales Order > Sales Order`.
3. Enter order type or sales org: `1000`.
4. Enter new customer: `6790`.
5. Enter material: `M01` with quantity `1`.
6. Save the transaction (message indicates something is incomplete).
7. Order number is generated (e.g., `12072`).
8. Go to change or display mode and try to issue the output.
9. Error encountered: "No output has been selected for printing".

## Problem Analysis
- **Case 1**: Sales order with customer `1000` and material `M01` - Output issued successfully.
- **Case 2**: Sales order with customer `6790` and material `M01` - Output not issued.

## Debugging Approach

### Step 1: Check Configuration
- Verify configuration settings.
- No apparent issues found.

### Step 2: Debugging the Code
- Opening the standard SAP code (e.g., `MV45A`) is impractical due to complexity.
- Leverage functional knowledge to narrow down the scope.

### Step 3: Focus on Output Determination Procedure
1. Identify the output type and corresponding program.
2. Set a breakpoint in the program to catch execution when the output is issued.

### Step 4: Locate Output Type and Processing Routines
1. Navigate to `SPRO > IMG > Sales and Distribution > Basic Functions > Output Control > Output Determination > Output determination using condition technique > Maintain output for sales documents`.
2. Select output type: `BA00`.
3. Click on `Processing Routines`.
4. Identify the program for print output.
5. Copy the program name and open it in transaction `SE38`.
6. Set a breakpoint in the program (e.g., at the first line).

### Step 5: Execute the Program Again
1. Navigate to `VA02` (change mode).
2. Enter the last created sales order number (e.g., `12073`).
3. Go to `Extras > Output > Header > Edit`.
4. Check if the output is determined.

### Step 6: Analyze Results
- If the breakpoint is not hit, the routine is not being executed.
- Understanding the program flow is crucial for effective debugging.

## Conclusion
Understanding the program flow is essential for debugging issues in SAP. This will be covered in the next chapter, emphasizing the need for a systematic approach to troubleshooting in SAP. The explanation demonstrates the challenges of debugging standard SAP programs and the value of functional knowledge in narrowing down the search for the root cause of issues.


The provided text explains the process of debugging standard programs versus custom programs in SAP, specifically focusing on creating and troubleshooting sales orders. The scenario begins with the creation of a sales order using a standard customer and material. The user navigates through the SAP system to create a sales order, enters the necessary details, and successfully issues an output, which is then displayed in a print preview.

Next, the user attempts to create a sales order using a newly created customer instead of the standard one. Despite following the same steps and using the same material, the system displays a message indicating that something is incomplete. When the user tries to issue an output for this new sales order, they encounter an error stating that no output has been selected for printing. This discrepancy between the two cases prompts the need for debugging to determine why the output is not being issued for the new customer.

The user checks the configuration and finds no apparent issues, leading them to consider debugging the code behind the sales order. However, the complexity of the standard SAP code, which is extensive and difficult to understand, makes this approach impractical. Instead, the user leverages their knowledge as a functional consultant to narrow down the scope of the search. They focus on the output determination procedure associated with the order type, which contains the outputs linked to specific programs.

By identifying the output type and the corresponding program, the user sets a breakpoint in the program to catch the execution when the output is issued. They navigate through the SAP system to locate the output type and the processing routines, then place a breakpoint in the identified program. Despite this effort, the breakpoint is not hit when the user attempts to issue the output again, indicating that the routine is not being executed.

The text concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the program flow to effectively debug the issue. This understanding will be covered in the next chapter, emphasizing the need for a systematic approach to troubleshooting in SAP. The explanation demonstrates the challenges of debugging standard SAP programs and the value of functional knowledge in narrowing down the search for the root cause of issues.




In this video, we are going to understand debugging standard programs.

Versus custom windows of code.

I'm going to explain what it is.

But before I do that, let me create a sales order, issue an output and show you a problem.

I'm going to create a sales order.

Go to logistics, sales and distribution sales.

Order!

Sales order!

Now I am talking to you from an consultants perspective, but you could think of any transaction in

a Fi.

You could be posting a gmail account.

In.

You could be posting a gras.

Or creating a purchase order.

Now I'm going to use an order type or sales org.

1000.

Hit.

Enter.

Enter a customer of 1000.

And enter a material of M01 quantity of one.

Now I save this transaction.

And if I go back.

Interchange or display mode, I should be able to issue an output like so.

So select B as zero zero and click on print preview.

All right.

That's the print preview.

Now let me do something different.

Instead of choosing a standard customer 1000, I'm going to create a new customer.

So it does not matter what the process is to create a new customer.

I'm just going to create a new customer and use that customer instead of the standard 1000 customer

to create our sales order.

I'm choosing some random number, say 6790.

All right, So let's use that customer to create a sales order.

Same order type, same data.

So instead of poison, I'm going to choose 6790.

On the same material.

And hit save.

Now you see a message here saying something is incomplete.

That's fine.

Save it for now.

So the order number here is 12072.

Now let's go and issue an output.

Go to change mode or display mode and then try to issue the output.

No output has been selected for printing, so that means the app is not able to determine the correct

output.

Why is it the case?

Let's say this is a small issue that we want to solve.

Now we have created a sales order with a customer of 1000.

Things were working fine, but we have created another order with a different customer.

6790.

And I was not able to issue an output.

Why?

Well, there were two cases, right?

Case number one.

I created a sales order.

Using.

Customer 1000.

Material.

M0 zero one.

And I was able to issue an output.

Case number two.

Same thing.

Create a sales order.

Customer.

6790 same material, and I was not able to issue an output.

Why is it the case?

So let's see.

Let's open the sales order.

The order that we have trouble issuing the output and go to extras output header.

Edit.

And you see that no output was being determined.

So SAP could not determine the right output.

Now we want to debug this, right?

We have checked all the configuration.

Things look fine and still we're not able to figure this out.

Now we can open the code behind the sales order, freeze it and try to debug it, but it's a nightmare.

Let me show you why.

So if you go back.

And look at system.

Status.

And the program is mv 45 A.

Copy it and go open that code.

The only person who can understand this code is probably the person in SAP who has written it.

So what good is it if I put a breakpoint here?

So this is where your knowledge of the SAP system as a functional consultant comes in.

So I'm a consultant.

I know how outputs are issued, so I have an order type.

Board and each order type.

Is associated with an output determination procedure.

And each output determination procedure.

Contains a number of outputs.

And each output.

Is linked.

To a program and if you put a breakpoint in this program.

Then there is a high chance that you might hit that little program section when you execute an output.

So the point being, instead of starting all the way here and then going through the entire process.

To find out what's wrong.

We are trying to narrow down the execution of the logic so that there is a better chance that we might

find out where things are wrong easily instead of going through all the way from the beginning to the

end, which could be thousands and hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

So let's do something.

Let's go to the output type.

And to the output program.

Put a breakpoint there and see how it works out.

All right.

So how do we go about figuring out what's the output type?

Now, this is all SD specific, so don't worry if you don't understand this.

The point being I'm using the knowledge of the system as a functional consultant to narrow down the

scope of the search.

So go to Sbarro.

IMG.

Sales and distribution.

Basic functions.

Output control.

Output Determination.

Output determination using condition technique and maintain output for sales documents.

You know, we know the output type is be A00.

That's what we're expecting.

So go select bar zero zero.

And just click on processing routines and you'll see that for print output, the program is.

Blah, blah, blah.

Copy that.

And go to c 30 8/N, c 38, which is which is what we use to open a program.

Click display.

And put a breakpoint somewhere.

It could be just the first line.

Now that we have put a breakpoint over there, we can try and execute the program again.

Go to zero to.

Enter the last created sales order.

And that is 12073.

Hit enter.

Go to extras output header.

And edit.

Do you see an output here?

No.

Still, you don't see an output.

That means that that routine where we have put a breakpoint is not hit.

Why is that?

In order to understand this, we have to first understand program flow.

And that is the subject for our next chapter.
