# Structures

## Introduction
The provided text explains the concept of structures in SAP, specifically focusing on their role in the context of creating and debugging sales orders. A structure in SAP is described as a grid of data populated at runtime, which resembles a table but is not one. Unlike tables, structures do not contain data persistently; they only hold data temporarily during the execution of a program.

## Example Scenario

### Setting a Breakpoint and Creating a Sales Order
1. Set a breakpoint in a routine.
2. Create a sales order using a known customer.
3. Save the sales order to trigger the debugger.

### Examining the Structure
1. In the debugger, double-click on `com KB v1`.
2. The current value of the field `UVA all` is displayed.
3. Remove the specific field and press enter to view the entire structure and its columns.

## Viewing Structures and Fields

### Using Transaction SE11
1. Open transaction `SE11`.
2. Enter the structure name in the database table field.
3. Click on display to view the structure and its fields.
4. Note that a structure is different from a table; it only contains data at runtime.

### Difference Between Structures and Tables
- **Structure**: Contains data only at runtime, serving as a temporary storage place during program execution.
- **Table**: Contains persistent data that can be viewed at any time using transaction `SE16`.

## Debugging Example

### Checking the Field `UVA all`
1. The field `UVA all` is checked to determine if the sales order header is complete.
2. The value of this field indicates the general incompletion status of the header.
3. If the value is not equal to 'C' (completely processed), the program exits, meaning the output cannot be issued.

### Resolving the Issue
1. Complete the missing data in the sales order, such as Incoterms and payment terms.
2. Once the document is complete, the value of `UVA all` changes to 'C'.
3. The program can then proceed and issue the output.

## Summary
- **Understanding Structures**: Structures are grids of data populated at runtime, resembling tables but not containing persistent data.
- **Viewing Data in Structures**: Use transaction `SE11` to view the definition of a structure and its fields.
- **Difference Between Structures and Tables**: Structures contain temporary data during program execution, while tables contain persistent data.
- **Debugging**: Functional knowledge is crucial for identifying and resolving issues related to structures in SAP.

## Detailed Example

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Set a Breakpoint and Create a Sales Order**
   - Set a breakpoint in the routine.
   - Create a sales order using a known customer.
   - Save the sales order to trigger the debugger.

2. **Examine the Structure**
   - In the debugger, double-click on `com KB v1`.
   - View the current value of the field `UVA all`.
   - Remove the specific field and press enter to view the entire structure and its columns.

3. **View the Structure Using SE11**
   - Open transaction `SE11`.
   - Enter the structure name in the database table field.
   - Click on display to view the structure and its fields.

4. **Check the Field `UVA all`**
   - Determine if the sales order header is complete by checking the value of `UVA all`.
   - If the value is not equal to 'C', the program exits.

5. **Resolve the Issue**
   - Complete the missing data in the sales order (e.g., Incoterms, payment terms).
   - Ensure the document is complete, changing the value of `UVA all` to 'C'.
   - Save the sales order and issue the output.

## Summary
- **Structures**: Temporary storage places for data during program execution.
- **Viewing Data**: Use transaction `SE11` to view structure definitions and fields.
- **Difference**: Structures contain runtime data, while tables contain persistent data.
- **Debugging**: Functional knowledge is essential for resolving issues related to structures in SAP.




The provided text explains the concept of structures in SAP, specifically focusing on their role in the context of creating and debugging sales orders. A structure in SAP is described as a grid of data populated at runtime, which resembles a table but is not one. Unlike tables, structures do not contain data persistently; they only hold data temporarily during the execution of a program.

To illustrate this, the text walks through an example where a breakpoint is set in a routine, and a sales order is created using a known customer. When the sales order is saved, the debugger is triggered due to the breakpoint. By examining the structure com KB v1 and its field UVA all, the current value of the field is displayed. This field is part of the structure and represents a column within it. By removing the specific field and pressing enter, the entire structure and its columns are displayed, showing all the fields within the structure.

The text further explains how to view the structure and its fields using transaction SE11. It clarifies that a structure is different from a table in that it only contains data at runtime, serving as a temporary storage place during program execution. Once the program finishes, the data in the structure is no longer available. This is contrasted with tables, which contain persistent data that can be viewed at any time using transaction SE16.

In the debugging example, the field UVA all is checked to determine if the sales order header is complete. The value of this field indicates the general incompletion status of the header. If the value is not equal to 'C' (completely processed), the program exits, meaning the output cannot be issued. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the functional aspects of the system, as this knowledge helps identify why the output is not being issued.

To resolve the issue, the text guides the user to complete the missing data in the sales order, such as Incoterms and payment terms. Once the document is complete, the value of UVA all changes to 'C', allowing the program to proceed and issue the output. The text concludes by summarizing the key points: understanding what structures are, how to view data in structures, the difference between structures and tables, and how to view the definition of a structure using transaction SE11.



In this chapter, we are going to talk about structures.

What is a structure?

A structure is a grid of data that is populated by SAP at runtime.

Now.

It's not a table, but it looks like one.

Let's take the same example and analyze the structure.

So we put a breakpoint in our routine and I'm going to create a sales order.

Using the same customer that we have known.

And as soon as I try to save it, it should trigger the debugger.

Why?

Because we have put a breakpoint here.

Let's see what this really means.

So go ahead.

Put your mouse over there and double click it.

Just double click on com KB v1 and it's shown here.

What is the current value of it?

A.

The current value of it is a.

And this over here come Cbve One is an example of a structure and UVA all.

Is a column in that structure.

If you want to see the entire structure, what you can do is just delete this field the column and click

enter.

And you see that it's a structure.

You can double click on this.

And then it will show you all the values or columns in that structure.

And there you go.

So this is the structure com KB one and the columns or fields in that structure are these vb v k r v.

Doesn't matter what they are, but these are all the different columns in that structure.

So if you go down below, you should be able to see the.

There you go.

You will.

And the value of it is a.

Just before we go further, let me show you how to see the structure of one and the different fields

in it.

What they really mean and all that stuff.

Go open another screen.

Go to 11.

And in the database table field just put in the structure.

And click on display.

And it tells you that it's not a table but a structure.

And what's the difference between a table and a structure?

A table contains data all the time.

But a structure contains data only at runtime.

What do I mean by runtime?

Runtime means when the program is being executed.

When a program is being executed.

The structure is filled with data.

It's like a temporary storage place.

And once the program finishes execution, for example, sales order is saved.

Closed.

Then there is no longer any data in the structure.

So once again, a structure is a temporary storage place in a program where the values are stored at

runtime.

When I mean runtime, it's during the execution of the program.

And when the program finishes execution.

There is no longer any data in that structure.

So if you go to SC 16 and try to view data in a structure, you won't have any values.

Because there is no data there.

It's just a temporary place during the program execution when data is filled up and after that it's

gone.

Whereas if you go open a table in C 16, you would definitely have some data.

If it has data.

All right.

So our structure here is com cbv one.

And the value that that program is checking is U.V.

All right.

So go to find and click on UV all.

So this is the field that we're looking at you all.

And what does it mean?

It means general incompletion status of the header.

Now we are on to something, isn't it?

So we said.

Com KB1.

Is a structure.

And we said a structure is a grid of data which contains fields field one, field two, field three,

field four.

And one of the fields is you've all.

The value of it at runtime when the program sales order is being executed, the value of it was a.

I put a single quote here to signify that it's a single character or a string, but the value that it

is checking over there is not equal to C, meaning if that value, whatever that value is, you all

is not equal to C, then exit.

That means if it is not equal to C, exit the program, in other words, it should be C for the output

to be issued.

But the current value is a.

Now, again, your Abap consultant will not be able to help you with this.

This is where your knowledge as a functional consultant comes in.

So what is this field?

You we all we know it's general incompletion status.

And as a functional consultant, I should understand what incompletion status means.

As an SD consultant, I know that there is something called as a completion status at the header and

at the line item level, and this one talks about the status of the header level.

What are the different values?

Just go double click.

You've all.

And double click the domains that we.

Click on value ranges.

And you'll see that a means not yet processed and C means completely processed.

Let's go back to this statement.

What this field means is the completion status of the header.

So if it is fully processed, see.

Then proceed if it is not equal to fully processed, meaning it is partially processed or not yet processed.

A or B or blank, then exit.

Right.

It's making sense now.

The logic in that program just says that if the header of the sales order is not fully processed from

an incompletion perspective, exit the program.

Let's go back and stop the debugging by clicking on this button.

Do you really want to exit?

Yes.

And go back to create the sales order again.

And let's see where we went wrong.

Save it.

It's going to start the debugger.

But that's okay.

We don't care.

Execute it.

Executed and it says document is incomplete.

In the previous videos we have seen this case, but we have just chose to ignore it and click on Save.

But this time we will see where the document is incomplete.

What is incomplete Incoterms payment terms.

Da da.

So let's go back and fill that piece of data.

So go to header.

Incoterms.

Just put in some incoterms.

That's okay.

Now.

Check if the document is complete, click on edit In completion log.

The document is complete.

Now save it.

And it hits the break point again.

And now let's see what the values are.

So we're going to go step by step.

Okay.

Execute f6.

It went in.

Now just double click this.

The value of that is see.

That means that we have completed the document.

Now, if the document is complete, the value over here is C.

So this test over here should pass.

Let's see.

All right.

See it?

Skip this all the way and went to the next if statement.

So this test of if one end of this block of code was skipped because the value is now equal to C.

And then it goes on to do a bunch of other tests, which we don't care at this point.

Let's say we hit.

Execute.

Execute.

Execute.

And the order has been saved.

Go to view or change the sales order.

Enter your order number.

Go to sales Order.

Click show output.

There you go.

We got our output.

Yay!

So what?

What did we learn here?

We learned what?

Are.

Structures.

We know how to view the data.

In structures.

And this is at runtime.

We know the difference between the data that's populated in a structure versus the data that's populated

in a table.

So a structure is always runtime.

Versus a table which has got static data all the time.

And we know that in SC 16 the data browser.

You can see the data in a table.

But not in a structure.

And we know how to view the definition of a structure.

Go to C11.

Enter the structure name and you can see the fields in that structure.
