# Debug Replace

## Introduction
The provided text explains the concept of "debug replace" in SAP debugging, which allows you to temporarily change the values of variables at runtime to see how the system reacts. This technique is useful for simulating different scenarios and understanding how changes in variable values affect the program's execution.

## Identifying the Starting Point for Debugging

### Method 1: User Exit or BAdI
1. Know the user exit or BAdI.
2. Set a breakpoint there and start debugging.
3. SAP will start at the breakpoint, allowing you to debug from that point onwards.

### Method 2: Message in the Code
1. Identify a particular message in the code.
2. Set a breakpoint on that message and start debugging.
3. SAP will start at the breakpoint, allowing you to debug from that point onwards.

## Viewing Data at Runtime
- Viewing data in structures or variables is similar to analyzing different parameters of a golf swing at various points.
- You can freeze the frame (set a breakpoint) and identify different values (e.g., speed, angle) at specific points in time.

## Debug Replace Concept
- Debug replace allows you to temporarily change variable values at runtime and observe how the system behaves.
- This technique is useful for simulating different scenarios and understanding how changes in variable values affect the program's execution.

## Example Scenario

### Debugging a Sales Order
1. Set a breakpoint in the output routine.
2. Execute the program and SAP stops at the breakpoint.
3. Examine the values of variables and identify issues (e.g., incompletion logs, delivery blocks).
4. Use debug replace to temporarily change the value of a variable (e.g., marking an incomplete document as complete) and see if the output is issued.

## Usefulness of Debug Replace

### External Systems
- Debug replace is useful in scenarios where external systems are involved (e.g., tax calculations, freight charges).
- External systems return values that are not under your control.
- By using debug replace, you can simulate different return values and test how the program handles them.

## Detailed Example

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Set a Breakpoint**
   - Set a breakpoint in the output routine.

2. **Create a Sales Order**
   - Create a sales order and save it.

3. **Check the Value of a Field**
   - Double-click on the field to check its value.
   - If the value is not as expected, use debug replace to change it temporarily.

4. **Change the Value Using Debug Replace**
   - Click on the pencil button.
   - Change the value and hit enter.

5. **Continue Execution**
   - Execute the program step by step.
   - Check if the output is issued.

### Example: External System Logic
1. **Scenario**
   - SAP calls an external system for a particular logic (e.g., tax calculation, freight charges).
   - The external system returns a value that affects the program's flow.

2. **Using Debug Replace**
   - Use debug replace to simulate different return values from the external system.
   - Test how the program handles these values.

## Conclusion
- Debug replace is a powerful tool for SAP debugging that allows you to change variable values at runtime and control the program's flow.
- It is useful for simulating different scenarios, especially when dealing with external systems or complex logic.
- By temporarily modifying variable values, you can gain insights into how the program behaves and identify potential issues more effectively.





The provided text explains the concept of "debug replace" in SAP debugging, which allows you to temporarily change the values of variables at runtime to see how the system reacts. This technique is useful for simulating different scenarios and understanding how changes in variable values affect the program's execution.

In previous chapters, two methods for identifying the starting point for debugging were discussed. The first method involves knowing the user exit or BAdI (Business Add-In) and setting a breakpoint there to start debugging. The second method involves identifying a particular message in the code and setting a breakpoint on that message to begin debugging. Both methods allow you to dive into the code and view data in structures and variables at runtime, similar to analyzing different parameters of a golf swing at various points.

The text uses a golf swing analogy to explain the concept of viewing data at different points in time. Just as you can freeze a golf swing to analyze parameters like speed and angle, you can set breakpoints in a program to view the values of variables at specific points. However, the text goes a step further by introducing the idea of changing variable values at runtime to simulate different scenarios. This technique, called "debug replace," allows you to temporarily modify variable values and observe how the system behaves.

An example scenario is provided to illustrate the use of debug replace. Suppose you are debugging a sales order and trying to issue an output, but the output is not being printed. By setting a breakpoint in the output routine, you can examine the values of variables and identify issues such as incompletion logs or delivery blocks. Instead of fixing the issue directly, you can use debug replace to temporarily change the value of a variable (e.g., marking an incomplete document as complete) and see if the output is issued.

The text also highlights the usefulness of debug replace in scenarios where external systems are involved. For example, tax calculations or freight charges might be determined by external systems, and the returned values are not under your control. By using debug replace, you can simulate different return values and test how the program handles them. This technique is particularly useful when you need to debug code that depends on external inputs.

In summary, debug replace is a powerful tool for SAP debugging that allows you to change variable values at runtime and control the program's flow. It is useful for simulating different scenarios, especially when dealing with external systems or complex logic. By temporarily modifying variable values, you can gain insights into how the program behaves and identify potential issues more effectively.




In the previous chapters.

We have seen two ways to identify the starting point for debugging.

The first way.

Is that you should know the user exit or the body or whatever.

And then put a breakpoint there and start debugging.

And SAP will start right at the point where you have set the breakpoint and then you can debug from

that point onwards either before or after.

So the first one is.

You know.

The user exit or.

Body.

The second way is to identify a particular message in the code.

And then put a breakpoint on that message and start the debugging.

So the second way is.

You go.

Bye bye.

The message.

So two ways you can dive into the code.

And at runtime we have seen examples of how we can view the data in structures, variables, so on and

so forth.

If you remember the golf example.

Viewing data, either in structures or in variables.

It's more or less like viewing the different parameters of your golf swing at any given point in the

swing.

Let me show you.

So this is me.

I start the golf swing here?

And then I'm supposed to hit say.

100mph here.

I can freeze the frame here.

And identify the different values.

Say speed.

60mph.

Angle.

See 30 degrees.

Once the swing starts here.

There's nothing we can do, right?

All you can do is just view the parameters at different points in time.

This is definitely useful, no doubt about it.

Freezing the frame or putting a break point and identifying what the different values are is the fundamental

aspect of debugging.

It's the most useful aspect of debugging.

But let's go one step further.

Imagine this scenario.

If I want to hit it at 100mph.

And my speed here is 60.

Say I'm not reaching.

100 year.

Now what do I do?

We could do a little simulation.

So we change the value of this variable temporarily to 70.

Meaning what would happen if the speed over here is 70 instead of 60?

Can we simulate that?

Wouldn't that be nice if I can do that?

That means if I can achieve this speed, then probably I can achieve my desired target.

So the ability to change the values at runtime.

And see how the system reacts.

It's called debug replace.

Let's see an example.

Let's go to the same old example.

You find out that there is a sales order.

And we are trying to issue an output.

The output should print a PDF, but it's not doing it.

So you want to debug.

What will you do?

You go to the output routine, which is a piece of code.

Put a breakpoint here.

Execute the program and SAP comes and stops here and waits for you to proceed further.

Step by step, step in, step out.

Execute.

What can you do now?

Say at this break point, we have realized that something is missing, say the incompletion log or there

is a delivery block or whatever.

There is an issue.

And that's what we have found out when we have put a break point here.

Now we have two options here.

Option number one.

Is to go.

Fix the issue.

The issue could be incompletion.

The issue could be delivery block.

The issue could be anything.

That stops the output from being issued.

The second option is.

We could simulate.

We could fool the system.

We could trick the system into saying, hey, you know what?

This is all good.

Go ahead.

Go further.

Example, the document is incomplete and that's what we have found out using our debugging.

And how did we find that out?

They said.

Com k b1 you will equal to a a means.

It's not complete.

C means it's complete.

Because it is a the system says exit, and that's how the code has been written.

And instead of going back and fixing the completeness of that document or whatever.

We could temporarily make this to see and say, hey, you know what?

The document is complete.

Go ahead.

Issue the output.

This is what I meant by tricking the system or fooling the system into believing that something that

is not true is true.

So let's see that in action.

So go to Sbarro.

So we've put a breakpoint here.

And.

Let's go create another sales order.

And save it.

Let's go check.

What is the value of this field?

Double click.

And the value is a And if the value is not equal to C, the system is going to exit.

But what do we want to do?

We want to trick the program.

We want to change this value temporarily and say, hey, you know what?

Everything is good.

Don't quit the program.

And in order for us to do that, we have to change the value to see.

How do you do that?

Very simple.

Click on the pencil button.

Change the value to C and hit enter.

Now watch what happens.

The arrow is right here.

Now we're going to go one step further.

And if com cbc1 is not equal to C, it's going to exit.

But we've made it C, so it's not going to exit.

Right.

So we tricked the system by changing a value into saying the document is complete.

Don't worry.

Go is an output.

Let's see if it really issues an output.

We're not going to debug any further.

We're just going to say execute.

Execute.

Execute.

And then say save.

Now, ideally, it would not have issued an output, but let's see if it did issue an output.

So go to sales document display.

And sales document issue output, too.

And there you see your output.

So this is how you use debug replace.

To temporarily trick the system or temporarily simulate a scenario to achieve what you want.

Now, most of you might have a question here.

When I can go complete a document in zero to.

What is the advantage of doing debug replace?

This is just an alternate way to do things.

Very good question.

Let me give you an example.

Where debug replace is going to be extremely useful.

Logic that happens in external systems is not under your control.

Right.

What example?

Say there is an order that is created in SAP.

Sales.

Order!

Purchase.

Order!

Transfer.

Order!

Doesn't matter.

SAP calls an external system.

For a particular logic.

It could be anything.

We are going to see some examples.

And during the process of creating a sales order.

If this returns something, it's going to do something else.

And if it does not return it, it's going to do something else.

If it returns a true.

It's going to proceed further.

If not, it's going to do something else.

If you want to know some examples.

Tax calculation in the US is a very good example of this.

Say there is an escape system and tax in the US is based on what is called as a jurisdiction code.

Well as the or for consultants would have a very good idea of what this is.

But for the rest of us, let's just say the tax is calculated outside of SCP.

It could be vertex tax where or any system, and then it returns a percentage saying the customer is

taxable.

And it's taxable at 8%.

Another simple example is.

You want to ship some goods to a customer?

And how do you get the fright?

You have a connection with a Fedex system or UPS system and you give some parameters, say the state.

That it's going to ship to the weight.

Volume.

So on and so forth.

And it's going to return.

A value.

Say $21 is the freight.

I can go on and on and on, but I think you get the point.

Wherever SAP executes a function that returns a certain value.

And that function could call another external system, or it could be even internal.

The point being, you don't have a lot of control over what is being returned.

I take the examples of external systems.

Why?

Because you don't know what the return.

It's a call that goes over the network and gets you some value.

So and if the code is written in such a way that.

If.

The customer is taxable.

Equals.

True.

Then do this logic.

Else.

Exit.

Now, when you're testing some things, this system might not be under your control.

So you want to simulate a scenario where this is true and then find out what's wrong in this piece of

code.

So this is the piece of code that you want to debug.

And unless this if statement is met or.

It is.

It passes.

The code will not come here.

Now in situations like this, you can use debug replace.

You can just make this true irrespective of what the external system returns.

That way you can easily debug programs under situations where the values of the variables are not under

your control.

All right, so that was debug replace.

So let's summarize what we have learned in debug replace.

Debug replace is a quick way.

To change the values of the variables at runtime so that you can control the way the program flows.

What are some examples of debug replace?

We have seen one example with outputs.

Another example or a more useful scenario.

Is when a function executes and returns a value.

What the function does is not under your control.

In cases like that, you can use debug replace to change the value of the variable.

To whatever you want.

So that was debug replace.

See you in the next chapter.
