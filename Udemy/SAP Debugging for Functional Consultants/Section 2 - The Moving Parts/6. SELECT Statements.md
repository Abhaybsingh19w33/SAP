# SELECT Statements

## Introduction
The provided text explains the process of debugging using messages and SELECT statements in SAP. It begins by reiterating that messages are a good starting point for debugging. When a message is encountered at runtime, SAP stops at the breakpoint, and the goal is to understand what led to the message being thrown.

## Example Scenario

### Running a Cost Center Report
1. Execute the cost center report.
2. The system provides results.
3. If the results are not as expected, the user might complain about incorrect data.
4. This scenario necessitates debugging to determine where the program might be going wrong.

## Debugging Approach

### Understanding Program Flow
1. **Selection Data**: The program retrieves selection data (e.g., company code, selection period, cost center).
2. **Data Processing**: The program processes the data.
3. **Display Output**: The program displays the output.

### Role of Functional Consultants
- Verify if the program is accessing the correct tables and fetching the right data.
- Leave detailed processing logic to ABAP consultants due to its complexity.

## Debugging Using Messages

### Identifying the Message Class and Number
1. Click on the help option when the message is displayed.
2. Note the message class and number (e.g., `RP016`).

### Viewing the Message Class
1. Open transaction `SE91`.
2. Enter the message class and number.
3. Click on display to view the message.

### Using the "Where-Used" Button
1. In `SE91`, click on the "Where-Used" button.
2. Filter the results to focus on the specific program being debugged.
3. Identify the exact lines of code where the message is being triggered.

### Setting Breakpoints
1. Set breakpoints at the lines where the message is being triggered.
2. Execute the program again with the breakpoints set.
3. The debugger will pause the program's execution at the critical points where the message is issued.

## Debugging Using SELECT Statements

### Understanding the SELECT Statement
1. **Structure of a SELECT Statement**:
   - **Select What**: Specifies the fields to be selected.
   - **From Which Tables**: Specifies the tables from which data is to be fetched.
   - **Conditions (Where Clause)**: Specifies the conditions under which data is to be fetched.

### Example of a SELECT Statement
- Example: `SELECT sales orders FROM VBAK WHERE date < today`.

### Verifying Data with SE16
1. Use transaction `SE16` to check if the table contains the expected data based on the selection criteria.
2. Cross-verify the data fetched by the SELECT statement with the data in the table.

## Detailed Example

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Identify the Program**
   - Go to `System > Status`.
   - Copy the program name.

2. **Open the Program in SE38**
   - Open transaction `SE38`.
   - Paste the program name and click display.

3. **Find the Message Class and Number**
   - Click on help when the message is displayed.
   - Note the message class and number (e.g., `RP016`).

4. **View the Message Class in SE91**
   - Open transaction `SE91`.
   - Enter the message class and number.
   - Click on display.

5. **Use the "Where-Used" Button**
   - Click on the "Where-Used" button.
   - Filter the results to focus on the specific program.
   - Identify the lines of code where the message is triggered.

6. **Set Breakpoints**
   - Set breakpoints at the identified lines.
   - Execute the program again.
   - The debugger will pause at the breakpoints.

7. **Debugging the SELECT Statement**
   - Place the cursor on the statement where you want the execution to go.
   - Use the "Go to Statement" option in the debugger.
   - Step into the routine to examine the SELECT statement.
   - Verify if the SELECT statement is fetching data from the correct tables and under the right conditions.
   - Use transaction `SE16` to cross-verify the data.

## Conclusion
- Messages provide a starting point for debugging large chunks of code.
- SELECT statements are used to fetch data from database tables.
- Functional consultants can use messages and SELECT statements to dive directly into the code at the points where issues are occurring.
- Tools like the debugger and SE16 are essential for identifying and resolving issues in SAP programs.





The provided text explains the process of debugging using messages and SELECT statements in SAP. It begins by reiterating that messages are a good starting point for debugging. When a message is encountered at runtime, SAP stops at the breakpoint, and the goal is to understand what led to the message being thrown. The text uses an example of a cost center report to illustrate this process. The report contains multiple blocks of code, and breakpoints are set at specific lines. When SAP stops execution at a breakpoint and throws a message, the focus is on what happened before the message was thrown.

The text explains that the yellow arrow in the debugger represents the exact line where SAP has stopped. The previous line contains an if statement that checks if an internal table (similar to a structure) is initial (i.e., empty). If the table is empty, the message is thrown. The task is to find out why the internal table was not filled with data. To do this, the debugger is used to move up in the program and examine the statements that led to the message.

The text describes how to use the debugger to move to the previous statement and start debugging from there. It explains the concept of a perform statement, which calls a routine or function (a block of code). By stepping into the routine, the debugger allows the user to go through the code line by line. The text introduces the SELECT statement, which is used to fetch data from database tables. A SELECT statement typically consists of three parts: what data to select, from which tables, and under what conditions (specified in the where clause).

The example provided shows a SELECT statement fetching data from a table based on certain conditions. The text emphasizes that the purpose is not to understand the entire SELECT statement but to verify if it is fetching data from the correct tables and under the right conditions. The user can cross-verify this by using transaction SE16 to check if the table contains the expected data based on the selection criteria.

The text concludes by summarizing the key points learned: understanding messages and their definitions, using the where-used function to identify where messages are triggered in the program, using the debugger to navigate through the code, and understanding the structure of SELECT statements. The explanation highlights the importance of functional knowledge in debugging and how to use tools like the debugger and SE16 to identify and resolve issues in SAP programs.



All right.

So we have seen in the previous chapter that messages are a good starting point to do debugging.

So we have hit this message here at runtime.

SAP has stopped at this breakpoint.

Now what?

So it's like this.

So this Cost center report.

Contains a bunch of blocks of code, and each block, again, could contain a bunch of blocks.

And we have identified breakpoints somewhere here and here, say, and the sap has come all the way

and stopped its execution here.

And then it's throwing that message.

The message is not what we want to debug, it's what happens before that message.

That has led to this message being thrown.

That's what we want to find out.

The situation that has resulted in that message being thrown could potentially have happened anywhere

before this line.

But more often than not, it happens just before one line, two line, three lines, not more than that.

Most of the time.

So let's find out what has happened that has resulted in this message being thrown.

So we know the yellow arrow represents the exact line in the program where SAP has currently stopped,

and the previous line here states that if select.

Da da da.

His initial then through this message and stop the program.

Well, it has stopped the program, but we want to find out what has resulted in it.

So the statement over here, if select underscore coastal.

Select Underscore.

Coastal is an internal table.

Which is similar to a structure.

So it's a grid of data that's populated at runtime.

And this statement says if this structure or internal table is initial.

Initial meaning that there is no data in it.

So if there is no data in this structure or internal table through this message.

Well, for some reason, this internal table was not filled up.

So it is initial, which means it's blank.

And so that message was thrown.

Fair enough.

Now let's find out where exactly the structure is being filled.

So we got to move up in the program, not move down.

So programs typically flow down.

Top to bottom or in loops.

But in this case.

You want to go up one statement and find out what has happened?

How do you do that?

So we know what this if statement does, but we want to go one step up right here.

And start debugging from there.

How do you do that?

So place your cursor on the statement where you want the execution to go.

Go to debugger and click on Go to Statement.

You see, the arrow has moved up and placed its focus right on the statement where we want it to stop.

Now perform, blah, blah, blah.

We don't care what this is, but the statement says perform something.

Perform something means.

Execute a block of code, get and post date.

It is called a function or a routine and perform executes that function or routine.

So what is a function or routine?

It's a block of code.

So perform, get, seek and post date is asking to execute a chunk of code that's there in this routine

or function.

And then if you hit f6.

It executes that routine and comes back to the if statement.

Well, what does that tell us?

Nothing.

Right.

So it executes something and then comes to the if statement.

But we want to find out what exactly is happening in that chunk of code.

So, again, place your cursor there.

Click on, go to statement, and then instead of clicking the second button f6 click the first button.

I call it step into.

So if there is a block of code, SAP executes it and then goes to the next line.

But if you want to go into that block and go step by step, you can click on the Step into button.

So click on the step into and it's going into that little chunk of code.

And then what does it do?

Now we can go step by step.

F6.

And then there is a select statement.

What's a select statement?

A select statement is how data is fetched from the database table.

So a select statement essentially comprises of three blocks.

Select what?

And from.

Which tables.

It could be one or more than one table and.

The third part being where it is being pulled from.

So this contains the conditions.

Based on which the data is being pulled.

Example.

Select sales orders from VBA Table.

Where date less than today.

Right.

So it fetches all the data from VBA tables where the date is less than today.

Now, you might not need every bit of field from that table, but instead you can select what.

Meaning select sales order and sales order creation date from.

Sales order table.

Vbc.

Where?

Order date less than today.

This is typically the format of a select.

Now it could be more than one table, but we are not here to understand how select statement works.

But just understand that a select statement has three sections.

What?

The tables from where it selected and the conditions that are specified in the where clause.

Well, in this case, this program is selecting all these different fields.

Which is the what of what that select is doing.

And from which tables.

From T.

And what are the conditions?

And here are the conditions where this is equal to company code.

This is equal to P, so on and so forth.

Now, don't be overwhelmed with your select statement.

The purpose is not to understand the entire select statement, but to see in general if it is picking

data from the right tables and if it is fetching the right data.

In our case, it's fetching the data from p D table.

Well, if you are from a finance background or casting background or HR background, you might understand

it.

But I don't care.

I don't understand what the table is.

But if you are from that background, you would understand what the table is.

And then if it is fetching the right data, the right data, meaning the where condition and the list

of fields.

Well, let's go to AC 16 and find out.

If we should get any data for the selects that we have done, so go to C 16.

And type in p d.

The table that that select statement uses.

And for company code type in nein, nein, nein, nein, nein.

Does it have any data?

Oops.

It does not have any data.

Well, we know because we have put in a dummy code, but you get the idea, right?

So whatever company code you're using, you can go there, put in on your selection criteria and see

if you should get data.

And if you get data here and not in the select statement, then maybe you need further refinement.

Go filter by all the selection criteria company code.

Maybe there is a join with another table.

You have to go find out what data is in that table and all that complicated logic.

And this is very case specific if I'm an SD consultant.

And I'm looking at sales data.

So typically my sales order header table is back.

Item table is VBA.

Schedule in table is EP.

And status table is v-buck.

And so on and so forth.

Now, if I'm looking at a select that's pulling data for sales order header.

This is the table that that it should be pulling from.

I would know that as a functional consultant.

So whatever the report is doing, I can cross verify it here.

Sometimes it's not just one table, because if you want to look at the entire sales order, you should

be looking at these three tables together.

Sure.

I'll just go to NC 16 across all these tables one by one and see if I got the right data or not.

So in our case, the select statement is right because there is no data for that company code.

So the program is doing its job well.

So that's how you use messages to quickly go and dive into these blocks of code and figure out where

exactly things are going wrong.

And then you can go one step up or one step down using the Goto statement or execute and then go step

by step or go step into or step out of the program to find out what really is happening behind the scenes.

So let's summarize what we have learned here so we know what messages are.

And we know how to view.

The definition of a message.

And from there we know how to use the where used.

To identify what are the places in the program where this message is being thrown.

And then we also seen how to use the Goto statement to go up and down in the program to quickly understand

where potentially things might have gone wrong.

Number five.

We also seen what is a step into.

And step out.

So step in is five.

A step out is F7 and of course F6 is how you execute line by line.

And then we have seen.

A select statement.

We have seen the structure of a select statement.

And we have seen some examples of how we can cross verify that with C 16.

Well, that concludes this chapter.

So see you in the next chapter.
