# Conclusion

## Course Overview
The provided text serves as a conclusion to a course on debugging for functional consultants in SAP. It begins by acknowledging the fast-paced nature of the course and the extensive range of topics covered.

## Importance of Debugging
The primary focus of the course was to emphasize the importance of debugging as an essential skill for any functional consultant. The rationale behind learning debugging is that while configuration can address many issues, customization often requires deeper insights, typically handled by ABAP consultants. However, functional consultants can benefit from understanding debugging to quickly identify potential problem areas and guide ABAP consultants more effectively.

## Specialized Knowledge of Functional Consultants
Functional consultants possess specialized knowledge of their respective areas, such as Sales and Distribution (SD) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which includes understanding specific tables, logic, and user exits. This domain knowledge enables functional consultants to debug problems more efficiently than ABAP consultants, who may not be familiar with every functional area.

## Practical Debugging Techniques

### Method 1: Debugging via System Messages
- System messages, whether errors, warnings, or informational messages, provide clues about where issues might be occurring.
- By examining the code around these messages, functional consultants can often pinpoint the root cause of a problem.

### Method 2: Debugging via User Exits or BAdIs
- Setting breakpoints in user exits, BAdIs, or business transaction events (BTEs) to monitor the program's execution at critical points.
- The mechanics of setting breakpoints and the different ways to execute a program during debugging, such as stepping through code line by line or executing blocks of code until a breakpoint is reached.

## Understanding Programming Constructs

### Structures and Internal Tables
- Structures in ABAP are similar to tables but are used to hold temporary data during program execution.
- The course explained how to view and analyze data within these structures.

### Watchpoints
- Watchpoints allow consultants to monitor specific variables and pause program execution when certain conditions are met, which is particularly useful in loops.
- This enables consultants to skip irrelevant iterations and focus directly on the iteration of interest.

## Summary of Key Points
- Debugging is an essential skill for functional consultants.
- Functional consultants' domain knowledge helps in identifying and debugging problems more efficiently.
- Practical debugging techniques include using system messages and user exits or BAdIs.
- Understanding programming constructs like structures, internal tables, and watchpoints is crucial for effective debugging.

## Conclusion
The course aims to equip functional consultants with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively debug SAP programs, ultimately enhancing their problem-solving capabilities and reducing dependency on ABAP consultants.

## Feedback and Gratitude
- The course encourages feedback from participants.
- Expresses gratitude for their participation in the course.
- Invites participants to send messages for additional content or improvements.

Thank you so much for taking this course and good luck with debugging.

The text highlights that functional consultants possess specialized knowledge of their respective areas, such as Sales and Distribution (SD) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which includes understanding specific tables, logic, and user exits. This domain knowledge enables functional consultants to debug problems more efficiently than ABAP consultants, who may not be familiar with every functional area. The course then transitioned into practical debugging techniques, explaining that there are two primary methods: debugging via system messages and debugging by identifying relevant user exits or BAdIs (Business Add-Ins).

System messages, whether errors, warnings, or informational messages, provide clues about where issues might be occurring. By examining the code around these messages, functional consultants can often pinpoint the root cause of a problem. The second method involves setting breakpoints in user exits, BAdIs, or business transaction events (BTEs) to monitor the program's execution at critical points. The text also covers the mechanics of setting breakpoints and the different ways to execute a program during debugging, such as stepping through code line by line or executing blocks of code until a breakpoint is reached.

Additionally, the course delved into understanding programming constructs like structures and internal tables. Structures in ABAP are similar to tables but are used to hold temporary data during program execution. The course explained how to view and analyze data within these structures. Finally, the concept of watchpoints was introduced as a powerful debugging tool. Watchpoints allow consultants to monitor specific variables and pause program execution when certain conditions are met, which is particularly useful in loops. This enables consultants to skip irrelevant iterations and focus directly on the iteration of interest.

In conclusion, the text reiterates the value of debugging skills for functional consultants, encourages feedback from participants, and expresses gratitude for their participation in the course. The course aims to equip functional consultants with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively debug SAP programs, ultimately enhancing their problem-solving capabilities and reducing dependency on ABAP consultants.




And now it's time to conclude what we have learned in this course.

It's a fast paced course, but we have learnt a lot of things.

We started all the way with understanding why debug programs.

So we started out with the why and what have we have realized is debugging is an essential skill for

any functional consultant.

So the reason why we do debugging is because as a functional consultant.

Your configuration will only take you so far.

Beyond that, there is a lot of customization.

And when you customize, you do that using a map.

Of course, your technical consultant does that for you, but nevertheless, it's being done.

And when you're trying to solve problems, anything that goes beyond configuration, which is what happens

90% of the time.

You're basically at the mercy of the above consultant.

Which is good.

Which is okay.

But you don't have to depend on them every time because sometimes it's like testing for landmines.

If you can quickly do a little bit of debugging and identify the broad areas where things could have

gone wrong, you could then direct your above consultant to probe further.

The second reason is, even though an Abap consultant can identify problems because he knows the code.

He might not know each functional area.

For example, SD has different set of tables, different set of logic, has different set of tables

and a different set of logic.

Same thing with CRM for SEO.

Since you know the area that you're working on, it's easy for you to identify the tables, the programming

logic, the messages, user exits, so on and so forth.

So as a functional consultant, your knowledge of the system, your knowledge of what's going on in

terms of functionality is going to be extremely useful to quickly identify and debug problems much better

than an above consultant.

And then we moved on to understand how to do debugging.

Basically, we have understood that there are two ways to do debugging.

The first method is to do debugging via system messages.

The system throws an error or a warning.

You figure out where exactly it's throwing that error.

Just go a little bit above and then you'll find out.

Probably some of the reasons why that error is happening in the first method.

Is where messages.

It could be warnings, errors or informational messages.

The second method is by knowing which user exit might potentially be the source of a problem.

So a good understanding of which user exit to put a breakpoint on or a body or a BT would be extremely

useful in most of the cases.

And of course we know how to put a breakpoint.

You just select that line and then hit the breakpoint button and you're done.

And we have seen some of the intricacies of how to do debugging, like step in, step out, execute,

which are the different ways in which you execute a program.

Is it line by line or is it one block at a time or you want to execute until you hit a breakpoint,

so on and so forth.

And then we have understood some things about programming and structures.

What is a structure?

A structure is like a table, and they are used a lot in Abap and we know how to view the data in a

structure, how to analyze the data in a structure.

And we have also seen some examples of internal tables.

And finally, we have also seen watch points.

A watch point is like a trigger.

You don't want to go through the entire loop to figure out what's really happening, maybe at line number

53.

So if there are 100 rows in an internal table that you are iterating and you want to find out what's

happening at line number 53, you set a watch point for line number 53.

You set a watch point for line number 53.

And the system stops right at line number 53, skipping through all the rest of the lines.

It's just a quick helper for you to debug programs.

That's it for debugging, for function.

That's it for debugging as a functional consultant.

I would definitely love your feedback.

If you need to see something else in the program, please let me know.

Send me a message and I'll try and add to this course.

Thank you so much for taking this course and good luck with debugging.
