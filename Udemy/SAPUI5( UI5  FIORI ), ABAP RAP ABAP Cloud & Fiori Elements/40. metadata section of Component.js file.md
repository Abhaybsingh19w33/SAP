we can define the service url for the model creation and we can instantiate the models create initial view and set up the routing

this service url is the path to the json file or it can also be a path to the odata service url as well 

this service url and the creation of the initial view both can be done inside metadata section 

so inside this metadata section of component.js we can define the root view like this and also configure the service url like this

```
"metadata": {
                "rootView": "satya.prasad.mvcapp.view.App",
                "config": {
                    "serviceUrl": "webapp/model/defaultmodel.json"
                }
            }
```

instantiation is not happening by this factory function but this is happening via metadata section root view attribute

```
var oView = sap.ui.view("appView",{
				viewName:"satya.prasad.mvcapp.view.App",
				type:sap.ui.core.mvc.ViewType.XML
			});
```

so whenever the super class create content method is being called by the framework this superclass method will in turn call the metadata section and metadata section will return the root view so the returned parameter of a root view can be captured inside a variable so we are naming that variable as oView so just like here we are getting the instance of oview from the factory functions but here we are getting the instance of the oview that is root view based on the superclass createContent method

```
var oView = UIComponent.prototype.createContent.apply(this, arguments);
```

After using the metadata, we are not able to navigate between pages, this is happening because the id is now generated by system.

This can be solved with routing
