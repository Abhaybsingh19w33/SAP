we are going to see about named models what are named models so there can be a

number of named models in an application and only one default model if at all we happen to

declare a model in manifesto.json file that is nothing but application descriptor then that the

model is going to be instantiated automatically so we do not have to write any piece of code

and also we are going to see about internationalization internationalization means

when our application runs in different languages

the application have to pick up specific language in which the user is logged in and accordingly

display the application in that particular language so with those a particular text which

which the developer maintains and also we will see how to test these resource models

so this internationalization can be performed with the help of resource models so from i18n file

we are going to maintain we are going to create resource models

go to the previous application from the previous class go to manifest.json i am going to create one

model so here if we can see this is the default model so in the models section there is a 18n

this is one model so this is nothing but resource model and now i am going to create one more model

i am going to name that model for every application as i said earlier

there can be only one default model and n number of unnamed models

i'm going to name it as named model and here i'm going to

change the path for that named model from which the model have to be instantiated

copy this one here and paste it name it as named model

i also want to change the data here i do not want to use the previous data

id is 3 so i am going to suffix every value of the model with 3 just for identification purpose

actually we are not going to use this so i'm going to keep it as it is

and now if we execute the application there is not going to be any change

the application will execute as it is without any issues now

go to the second view inside second.view.xml i want to use this simple form to retrieve

the data from the named model i'm going to name it as details3

and

i'm going to remove the expression binding syntax how to write the code for retrieving the data from

named model is named model greater than and then now the as usual syntax so if i want to display

the name here what i have to do is this is forward slash and then sweet supplier

inside sweet supplier array is there correct so this array is having two elements i want

to display the first element name how we have to write this code is

slash sweet supplier this forward slash is because it is a root node right this is a root node sweet

supplier is a root node so forward slash and then array element so forward slash again and

the array element and forward slash and now the name let us see if our change is going to work or not

we can see

details 3 sweet magic 3 our change is working fine so even though this complete view is bound to

the sweet magic row element but here we are displaying the data from some

other model completely different from whichever the row we are clicking on

so i just wanted to show you that control can be bounded the way we want to

bind okay so it can be binded in any way irrespective of what this view is bounded to

or else irrespective of what the simple form is bounded to so irrespective of any other control

each and every control can be binded in the way it can be it needs to be binded

now we have binded the value from the named model so i want to implement internationalization so

how to implement internationalization is first decide in which language this application needs to

be tested so once you have decided the language go to the settings inside the settings go to

language and once you go to the language just maintain a language preferred language

order language is based on your preference so maintain a language here as

the desired language in which you want to test the application so i have maintained telugu

now i have to come here and i copy this and paste it i have to maintain the file name in a specific

format i18n underscore language language here is thirugh for telugu the code is t e dot properties

how do i know the code is te is just go to the google

search with the telugu language code so whichever the language you want to test in

with the internationalization um search for that language code so here this is language the

code is te now i have maintained i18n underscore te.properties here whenever the name is appearing

name label is appearing in my application this name label have to be translated to

telugu language so that is my requirement which i am going to show it to you now so translate

name

i want to translate it to telugu

see here inside i18 and underscore te properties i have maintained a telugu label telugu language

label so in application it will always be name only but whenever we run the application

this telugu language is going to be picked up on by sapui5 application from the browser settings

inside the browser settings we have maintained telugu language correct so here we have maintained telugu

language as a preferred language so that is the reason instead of

displaying the text in english language it is going to find that telugu language file and

from this file whenever this label is encountered it is going to replace with the translation

text so let us see what is happening at the moment at the moment in second.view.xml

i want to place a translatable text here for the label how i can do it that one is i 18

n greater

than so i18n is the model resource model this is resource model

for internationalization we use resource model so what is resource model let us go to

ui5.sap.com and see what resource model is

see this is resource model this resource model is used for internationalization

here we can find all the methods and this is just a model actually

so if we have to display a text from model how to display it directly the text from the model

inside resource model go to the resource model i want to display the name from the model

so name label i want to display if i18n underscore te is not there

it is going to pick up the name from this file i18n.properties but since it is here

it is going to come and pick up this text and display to us so let us see what is happening

see telugu language is being picked up and that is because this file is available if we

remove this file then it is going to pick up this default file so this default file means

inside our settings if we remove each and every language means so first our preferred language

is telugu then it is english our application our framework is going to look for first telugu

language if it finds the telugu language if it finds the label used from the resource model

it is going to translate this text to the value from the resource model so here the text is hello

this is placeholder hello and then place folder this is first placeholder we can place any number

of placeholders as possible like this 0 1 and so on placeholder means we can pass some text to

be displayed in this placeholder apart from this static text so this is dynamically we can pass it

from the programming so how we can do that one we will also see we can also test this

now by removing this te and as a fallback it will search for english as second preferred language

it will search for second file as english file so if it doesn't file second if it

doesn't find second file then it is going to display the text from i18n. properties

so that is how this translation works and let us see how to pass this placeholder

from our xml views okay i'm going to save the changes go come here

we can pass it by use of parts

in the parts we have to pass the array and then the modal values

here anyway this complete view is a bound to the element which is selected in the first

page correct every element so whatever is being displayed here in the id field i can pass it here

id sorry i can simply write id here or else we can also write name as well it doesn't matter

so whichever the model property we want to pass that can be typed here in the single quotes

and we have to make sure that we have to apply

formatter .in the formatter we have to pass this jquery dot sap dot format message

so we have to pass this one only once we pass this formatter we will be able to pass the placeholder

name value to this translatable text okay so and after the name a placeholder is there right

so inside that placeholder if this model value have to be passed we have to

pass or we have to use this formatter okay let us execute this and see

see 0 is bound 0 is bound here so 0 is being displayed

if at all we want to change it to name we can also do that anything any model property can be passed

see sweet magic sweet magic

yeah just go to ui5.sap.com

and go to the api reference and type in the page here sap dot m dot page

so go to the control sample

inside the control sample

go to the source code just copy paste this footer i want to show something with respect

to the resource model what is it i will let you know so after the content it is there right

so i am going to copy paste it there i also want to place an even handler for the button

ctrl s and now if you execute and see

it is working fine we are able to see the buttons in the footer i have not implemented

on press button event handler yet so i'm going to implement it now go to second.controller.js

and let us implement this event handler

okay and let us write the code before that i want to use sap m message toast

so what is this message toast and how to use it we will see it in the ui5 sdk

go again back to ui5 sdk search for message toast see here control sample is available go to the

control sample go to the source code here we can see inside sap.ui.define this message toast

is passed and this message toast is available as an argument to the

function and the message dot show is the method he has used inside the message he is passing some

message so the same thing which we are going to use now but

what we are going to do is

message toast dot show so var msg equal to this dot get view

i'm getting the view instance from the controller instance get a model which model i want to get

i am getting i18n model i18n is resource model correct so here there is something as

a method called get resource bundle okay so this resource bundle has a get a text

what this get text accepts is

the property which we need to fetch from i18n so i want to fetch name so what is name

what is name property inside this model go to the named uh go to i18n properties here this property

value i am fetching from get resource bundle okay so this get resource bundle as well as

inside the array we have to pass placeholders so i'm going to simply pass a text

hi how are you now let me execute this application and see what it is going to display

we are in the second page click on accept button see now what i am trying to show to you is

how we can concatenate the value from the resource model and the placeholder value okay

this is name with respect to name this translatable text is maintained right

so beside the translatable text there is also a placeholder so inside placeholder we are passing

our text which needs to be concatenated
