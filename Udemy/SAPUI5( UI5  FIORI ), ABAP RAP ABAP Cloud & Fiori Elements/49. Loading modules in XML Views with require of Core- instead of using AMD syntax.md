we can require modules in xml views as well instead of requiring the modules inside the controller inside the synchronous module definition syntax

we can also require the modules in xml views as well

why do you want to require the modules in xml view ? 

in order to avoid the global variables or we don't have to interact with the controller for using the helper functions 

the syntax for requiring the module in xml views is inside sap.ui.core namespace there is a require which accepts the object with name value properties so the name will be the alias which we can use in our xml view and the value will be the module which is needed to be required
