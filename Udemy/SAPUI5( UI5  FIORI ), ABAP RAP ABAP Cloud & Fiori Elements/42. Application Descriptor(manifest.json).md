```
"sap.app": {
		"id": "satya.prasad.mvcapp", 
		"type": "application",
		"i18n": "i18n/i18n.properties",
		"applicationVersion": {
			"version": "1.0.0"
		},
		"title": "{{appTitle}}",
		"description": "{{appDescription}}",
		"sourceTemplate": {
			"id": "ui5template.basicSAPUI5ApplicationProject",
			"version": "1.40.12"
		}
	}
```

id is the namespace 

i18n -  this is for internationalization so what is internationalization is if user logs in chinese language then chinese text has to be displayed if user logs in english language then only english text has to be displayed so by default if

if the text is not maintained in the application in this path in this i18n folder then this is the default file which has to be loaded 

```
title=Title
appTitle = App Title
appDescription=App Description
Name=Hello {0}
```

Title and description in manifest.json is read by Fiori launchpad so both the title and description which are maintained inside i18n.properties will be read from here 

so app title inside the manifest.json is pointing to app title, so it is read and it is shown to the title and description of the application is shown to the user inside a fiori tile when this application is loaded inside the fiori launchpad

All the metadata from compoenent.js file will be moved to manifest.json

then connect the component.js to manifest.json
```
"metadata": {
			manifest: "json"
		}
```
