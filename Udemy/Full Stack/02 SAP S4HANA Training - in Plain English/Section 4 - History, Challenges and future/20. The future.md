# The Future of SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section discusses the future direction of SAP S/4HANA, focusing on the evolution of its infrastructure and applications.

## Future Upgrades
### Infrastructure Upgrades
- **Tracks and Bogies**: The analogy of upgrading tracks and bogies to support higher speeds.
  - **Tracks**: Will be upgraded to support faster speeds.
  - **Bogies**: New bogies will be introduced that can run at 1000 mph.

### New Code and Applications
- **Shiny New Code**: S/4HANA will eventually have new, optimized code built with modern simplification models.
- **New Apps**: All new applications, whether developed by SAP or companies, will be built using the new simplified database model.
  - **No Aggregates and Indices**: New apps will not use aggregates and indices, leveraging the new database model directly.

## Current State and Evolution
### Transitional Hacks
- **Simulating Aggregates**: Existing applications work with the new model by simulating aggregates.
- **Incremental Changes**: SAP is taking a cautious, step-by-step approach to introduce changes.

### Examples of Changes
- **Sales and Distribution (SD)**:
  - **Version 1511**: Initial changes introduced.
  - **Version 1610**: More changes introduced.
  - **Future Versions**: Continued incremental updates expected.
- **Rebates**: Changes focused on cumulative balances.
- **Customer Vendor Integration**: Simplification of Customer Master and Vendor Master data into a single set of data and applications.

## Conclusion
The future of SAP S/4HANA involves significant upgrades and simplifications. While the current state includes transitional hacks, the long-term vision is for a faster, simpler system built on a modern database model. Understanding the key innovations and the direction of these changes is crucial for appreciating the full potential of SAP S/4HANA.

## Next Steps
- **Simplification Lists**: Further discussions on simplification lists.
- **Delta Functionality**: Exploration of Delta functionality as the evolution of SAP S/4HANA progresses.



So what will happen in the future?

Are the tracks going to stay the same?

Are they not going to be upgraded or the bogies not going to be upgraded?

Yeah, of course, the tracks will be upgraded.

There will be new brand new bogies that can run 1000mph.

Eventually, S4 Hana will have shiny new code.

Built with the modern.

Simplification models that SAP is suggesting and all new apps.

Will be built with the new database model.

So any time a new app is being built by SAP or by the company.

Because it's the new model, simplified model.

They'll not be building it with aggregates and indices.

They'll be building it straight off of the new database model, and that is the future.

It's not there yet.

Currently it's all hacks here, but new apps can definitely be built with a new model.

So this is the future.

Of s four Hana say five, ten, 15 years from now.

It's going to be so faster.

It's going to be so simpler.

And the reason why I'm mentioning these things is because currently s four Hana is evolving.

Don't just look at what it is as of this date.

As of today.

There are some set of apps and then the data model is changing and the existing apps work in the new

model by simulating aggregates.

But going forward, the changes are going to be enormous.

So SAP is taking a very cautious approach.

You know, it's going step by step.

For example, in SD in 1511, some changes were introduced and in 1610 more changes were introduced.

And I'm sure in 17 many more changes will be introduced.

And they're trying to focus on changes that has the most immediate effect.

For example, anything that's based on cumulative balances like rebates.

That is a prime candidate for change.

So rebates were changed.

And keeping in line with the simplification.

Customer Master.

Vendor Master.

Same set of data.

Different set of apps.

Why do that?

Simplify it.

That's called customer vendor integration.

That was introduced in with S four Hana.

So where possible SAP identifies the applications or application areas that benefit most from this kind

of simplification, and they keep introducing the new models and the new paradigms.

As the versions go along every year.

Once again.

The point being, don't just look at what it is currently.

Understand the key innovation.

And see how the future of these innovations are going to be.

So once you understand the key innovative features, it's no big deal to understand all the different

Delta functionality.

We'll talk more about simplification lists and Delta functionality as we go forward.
