# The Challenge with Simple Logistics

## Introduction
This section discusses the challenges SAP faces in simplifying logistics within the SAP S/4HANA framework.

## Background
### Traditional SAP ERP (R3)
- **Started**: 1992
- **Evolved Until**: 2015
- **Codebase**: Millions of lines of code
- **Database Model**: Complex with base tables, status tables, header tables, line item tables, and numerous aggregate tables.

### Simplified Database Model in S/4HANA
- **Key Features**:
  - Removal of aggregates
  - Removal of indexes
- **Performance**: HANA database is significantly faster than traditional databases.

## The Challenge
### Existing Codebase
- **Complexity**: Millions of lines of code written for the old database model.
- **Example**: Sales order creation involves 100,000 to 200,000 lines of code.

### Paradigm Shift
- **Old Model**: Relied on aggregates and indexes.
- **New Model**: Simplified with no aggregates or indexes.

## Analogy: Train and Jet Engine
### Traditional ERP System
- **Train**: Designed to run at 100 mph.
- **Components**: Tracks, engine, and bogies built for 100 mph.

### HANA Database
- **Jet Engine**: Capable of running at 1000 mph.
- **Challenge**: Fitting a jet engine onto a train designed for 100 mph.

## SAP's Solution
### Simulation of Aggregates
- **Hack**: Creating aggregates as views.
- **Result**: Existing code can run on the new simplified model, but not at full potential speed.

### Retrofitting Analogy
- **Temporary Solution**: Retrofitting tracks and compartments to allow faster speeds.
- **Limitation**: Not the ultimate solution for leveraging the full capabilities of SAP S/4HANA.

## Conclusion
The transition to SAP S/4HANA involves significant challenges due to the existing complex codebase and the shift to a simplified database model. SAP's interim solution of simulating aggregates allows for some performance improvements but does not fully realize the potential of the HANA database. This approach serves as a temporary step towards a more efficient and future-proof system.



Now, what is the challenge with simple logistics?

What is the challenge that SAP is facing?

Why not just rewrite all the code and then simplify things?

Here is the deal.

R3 or Urp.

As we know it.

SEC.

6.0 or, you know, six, ten whatever.

Enhancement pack.

I said started in 1992 as R3.

And has been evolving until 2015.

That was like 12 to 13 years.

So millions.

Of lines of code.

Has already been written.

For example, sales order create.

That's probably 100 or 200,000 lines of code.

It's a lot.

And that code has been written with the old database model.

The model where you have a set of base tables for sales order, you have wbup wbkp status tables.

Header tables.

Lineitem tables and then a whole bunch of aggregate tables.

30, 40, 50.

I don't know how many.

Same thing with purchase order.

Same thing with transfer order, same thing with customer master, same thing with all the different

apps.

And now they're coming up with a simpler model.

As for Hana.

Which has.

Simplified database model.

Which means removal of aggregates, removal of indexes.

This is a simplified database with no aggregates.

To put things in perspective.

Let me give you an example.

Now, we know Hana database is a, you know, 1000 times faster.

Then the traditional database.

What about all the million lines of code that are already written with the old database model?

How do you make that work in the new database and the new paradigm?

Paradigm has changed.

It simplified now no aggregates, no indexes.

But these million lines of codes are built with.

With reading and writing to these aggregates.

So to put things in perspective.

Imagine trains.

A train with tracks, right?

The tracks can go can take 100mph.

The engine and bogies are built with to withstand, say, 100mph journey.

Imagine that's the traditional ERP.

And in the new world.

The heart of the railway engine, the actual electric or diesel engine.

Imagine.

That runs.

Ten times just to keep things simple.

Not thousand times.

Just ten times.

So this engine can only run at 100mph.

But this engine, the new Hana database, can run 1000mph.

Now.

100 multiplied by ten is 1000.

You got a jet engine that runs 1000mph and ready to be fitted on a railway engine.

What happens?

Can the train now run at 100mph?

Not really right.

The tracks don't support 100mph.

The engine's body or chassis does not support 100mph.

And there are.

Hundreds of thousands of bogeys across the country.

That are built only to run 100mph.

Compare that to the millions of lines of code in the existing apps, sales orders, purchase orders,

transfer orders, production orders.

Customer master vendor.

Master.

These are all apps.

Built to run with the old model.

Aggregates indices.

So what happens to all those?

Well, the hack that SAP has done is.

To create some of these aggregates as views.

When these aggregates are created as views as we have seen in some of the previous chapters.

All these lines of code can now run with the new simplified model.

But still, it doesn't run at 1000mph.

It runs at, say, 500mph.

With.

The hack.

What is the hack?

Simulation of aggregates.

Think of this more like retrofitting the train's tracks or retrofitting the train's compartments.

The train can definitely run faster, but that's not really the future.

This is more or less like a temporary intermediary step.
