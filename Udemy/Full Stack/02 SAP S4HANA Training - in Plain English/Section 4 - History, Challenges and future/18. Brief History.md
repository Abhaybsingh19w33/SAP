Now we'll talk a little bit about the timeline of SAP s four Hana release.

And the future of S four Hana Which direction is it heading in now in terms of the timeline?

Somewhere in 1980, R2 was released.

That was probably the first version of SAP that ran on a mainframe.

And then.

R3 was released.

This was in 1992.

And it was a revolution because it's based on a client server platform.

Probably the first ERP of that scale that ran on a client server platform.

So this is mainframe.

This is client server.

What do you mean by client server?

So you have your GUI.

On your desktop, click on that, click on login.

Then it connects to your server.

This is somewhere in the network.

And then the server interacts with your database.

So this is your SAP server.

This is your sap GUI.

And the database could be anything.

Oracle, MySQL.

A whole host of databases are supported.

Fast forward to 2014 or 2015.

We have s four Hana.

See, this is two.

This is three, and you have four.

So after 1992.

In 2015.

We have the next generation of product from SAP.

This is next Gen.

And that's why you have that four.

It's the fourth generation suite.

So S stands for suite and four for fourth generation.

So what are the key features of this?

Simplification and.

Of course the next gen UI called theory.

The reason why I'm talking about this is you should understand that this is the next leap.

And things are going to be different.

Now let's focus on this particular section.

In 2011.

Hana as a database was released.

It's just a database.

That's it.

In 2012, BW The data warehouse product of SAP was built to run on Hana because that's where the analytics

are done.

So without simplifying the main ERP, the first thing that they've done is that they've ensured that.

BW The analytic engine runs on Hana, and it ran well.

Fast forward to 2013.

The entire ERP was put on Hana.

It's still not.

As for Hannah, it's still not the redesigned suite.

All they have done is replaced the database with Hannah.

Well, they didn't replace it.

They've given an option to replace.

So some pilot companies have done it and.

Let's prove that Hannah is really a good database and it can run and take those huge transactional workloads.

In 2014.

They introduced the first simplification.

That's called simple finance.

Simple finance.

Is basically.

A simplified version of.

As for Hannah, specifically for finance, Fico.

Why choose Fico?

Why finance first?

Why not PSD or.

Because finance is where the most effect can be seen.

And it was a hit.

People liked it.

So in 2015.

ASAP released s four Hana.

Which is a reimagined, recreated business suite, the ERP suite.

Created on the Hana platform with the Hana database as well as these code changes.

And then going forward, they released more versions of S four Hana and Simple Finance, just like how

it happens with any software.

Now in 2015, I said s four Hana was released, right.

In terms of versioning.

In March 2015, the first version of Simple Finance was released.

And this version was called 15 0303 because it's March.

And in November 2015.

Simple logistics was introduced or simple logistics or slag.

So this was called 15, 11, 11 because it's November.

And in 2016.

Again, another version of simple finance.

1603 And in October 2016, another version of simple logistics called 1610 was released ten for October.

Now, this is rapidly evolving every year.

There is one major release like 1511, one major release of simple logistics and 1610 one year later,

almost.

There is another major release.

And between that there are three.

If be is religious or feature packed stack.

So basically fixes any fix that is needed in 1511 are released every quarter.

Fixes and small enhancements.

No major change in functionality, but fixes and small enhancements.

So this is the timeline of how sap s four Hana The simple Logistics evolved.
