# Pricing Delta Changes

## Introduction
In this section, we discuss the changes in pricing within SAP S/4HANA. Overall, the changes in pricing are minimal, with no major structural changes. The pricing mechanism remains largely the same. However, there are four notable changes as of version 1610.

## Key Changes

### 1. Replacement of CONV with PRCD_ELEMENTS
In SAP ECC, whenever a sales document is created in VBA, a corresponding document condition number is generated. This document condition number links the sales document to the pricing conditions stored in the CONV table. For example, if you create a sales order and look up the document condition number, you would find the associated pricing conditions in the CONV table. However, in SAP S/4HANA, these entries are now stored in the PRCD_ELEMENTS table. This change means that the document condition number must be used to search the PRCD_ELEMENTS table instead of CONV.

### 2. Access Sequence and Pricing Procedure Step and Counter
In SAP ECC, the number of condition tables you can include in an access sequence is limited to 99. In SAP S/4HANA, this limit has been increased to 999, allowing for more extensive configurations. Similarly, the counter in the pricing procedure, which was previously limited to two digits, has been extended to three digits. This change allows for more detailed and granular pricing configurations.

### 3. Document Pricing Procedure and Customer Pricing Procedure
The document pricing procedure and customer pricing procedure have been expanded from one digit to two digits. In SAP ECC, the available characters for these procedures were limited, often requiring the use of special characters. In SAP S/4HANA, the expansion to two digits provides more flexibility and options for defining these procedures.

### 4. Post-Processing Step During Migration
When migrating pricing condition records from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA, a post-processing program named `PRC_MIGRATION_POST_PROCESSING` must be run. This program ensures that all necessary fields, such as document currency, are properly set. The program is designed to handle the migration of data from CONV to PRCD_ELEMENTS and is a one-time activity that must be executed after the technical migration. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the migrated pricing data.

## Detailed Explanation

### Replacement of CONV with PRCD_ELEMENTS
1. **Sales Document Creation**: Whenever you create a sales document in VBA, a corresponding document condition number is generated.
2. **Document Condition Number**: This number links the sales document to the pricing conditions stored in the CONV table in SAP ECC.
3. **New Table in S/4HANA**: In SAP S/4HANA, these entries are now stored in the PRCD_ELEMENTS table.
4. **Example**:
   - Create a sales order and look up the document condition number.
   - In SAP ECC, you would find the associated pricing conditions in the CONV table.
   - In SAP S/4HANA, use the document condition number to search the PRCD_ELEMENTS table.

### Access Sequence and Pricing Procedure Step and Counter
1. **Access Sequence**:
   - In SAP ECC, the number of condition tables in an access sequence is limited to 99.
   - In SAP S/4HANA, this limit has been increased to 999.
2. **Pricing Procedure Counter**:
   - In SAP ECC, the counter is limited to two digits.
   - In SAP S/4HANA, the counter has been extended to three digits.

### Document Pricing Procedure and Customer Pricing Procedure
1. **Expansion**:
   - In SAP ECC, these procedures were limited to one digit.
   - In SAP S/4HANA, they have been expanded to two digits.
2. **Flexibility**:
   - Provides more flexibility and options for defining these procedures.

### Post-Processing Step During Migration
1. **Migration Program**: `PRC_MIGRATION_POST_PROCESSING`
2. **Purpose**: Ensures all necessary fields, such as document currency, are properly set.
3. **Execution**: Must be run after the technical migration from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA.
4. **Importance**: Crucial for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the migrated pricing data.

## Conclusion
While the changes in pricing within SAP S/4HANA are minimal, they provide enhanced flexibility and capabilities compared to SAP ECC. These changes include the replacement of the CONV structure, increased limits for access sequences and counters, expanded document and customer pricing procedures, and a necessary post-processing step during migration. These updates are important for consultants to understand and implement effectively.

These are the key changes in pricing that you should be aware of, whether you are a consultant or an end-user.




In this section, we discuss the changes in pricing within SAP S/4HANA. Overall, the changes in pricing are minimal, with no major structural changes. The pricing mechanism remains largely the same. However, there are four notable changes as of version 1610.

The first change involves the replacement of the structure CONV with PRCD_ELEMENTS. In SAP ECC, whenever a sales document is created in VBA, a corresponding document condition number is generated. This document condition number links the sales document to the pricing conditions stored in the CONV table. For example, if you create a sales order and look up the document condition number, you would find the associated pricing conditions in the CONV table. However, in SAP S/4HANA, these entries are now stored in the PRCD_ELEMENTS table. This change means that the document condition number must be used to search the PRCD_ELEMENTS table instead of CONV.

The second change pertains to the access sequence and pricing procedure step and counter. In SAP ECC, the number of condition tables you can include in an access sequence is limited to 99. In SAP S/4HANA, this limit has been increased to 999, allowing for more extensive configurations. Similarly, the counter in the pricing procedure, which was previously limited to two digits, has been extended to three digits. This change allows for more detailed and granular pricing configurations.

The third change involves the document pricing procedure and customer pricing procedure, which have been expanded from one digit to two digits. In SAP ECC, the available characters for these procedures were limited, often requiring the use of special characters. In SAP S/4HANA, the expansion to two digits provides more flexibility and options for defining these procedures.

The fourth change is a post-processing step required during the migration from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA. When migrating pricing condition records, a post-processing program named PRC_MIGRATION_POST_PROCESSING must be run. This program ensures that all necessary fields, such as document currency, are properly set. The program is designed to handle the migration of data from CONV to PRCD_ELEMENTS and is a one-time activity that must be executed after the technical migration. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the migrated pricing data.

In summary, while the changes in pricing within SAP S/4HANA are minimal, they provide enhanced flexibility and capabilities compared to SAP ECC. These changes include the replacement of the CONV structure, increased limits for access sequences and counters, expanded document and customer pricing procedures, and a necessary post-processing step during migration. These updates are important for consultants to understand and implement effectively.


In this section.

We'll talk about the changes in pricing.

Overall, the changes in pricing are very minimal.

There are no major structural changes.

Placing will remain as is for the most part.

And regarding these small changes in pricing, I would say there are four changes as of 1610.

The first change is that the structure conv is replaced with PR CD underscore elements.

What do I mean by that?

So where is Convy used?

Whenever you create a sales document in VBA, okay, there will be a corresponding document condition

number.

So if you go to 010 to create an order number, say 700001 and there will be pricing for that, right?

Zero zero based on the line item number and then V00, all different kinds of conditions, discounts,

taxes, surcharges, whatnot.

All of these are stored in conv.

And the link.

Between the document number and conv is.

Document condition.

Number.

This is the primary key in CNB.

So let's look at a couple of sales orders.

See 16 Vbc.

Uh, how many are there?

Execute.

And then.

Let's pick the latest order.

70002.

If you double click the latest order number or any order number and look for the field called document

condition number.

In this case, it is.

143.

So let's open this document.

70002.

For the document number in their.

Then there is some pricing, right?

$100.

So if you double click that line item, go to conditions.

You see that there is A00, there is a tax, then some cash discount and internal price.

Right.

Now if you go to this table.

Conv.

Put the document condition number in there.

What's the document?

Condition number 143 143.

Then.

Search for it.

You will not find any.

This is an S for Hana, but if you were to do it in a standard SEC system.

You'll find all the entries.

In s four Hana.

These entries are available in the table.

Prcd.

Underscore elements.

So put 143 in there and hit.

Execute.

To see those conditions PR zero zero cash discount and the internal price.

So this is the first change.

The second change.

Is with the access sequence.

And pricing procedure step and counter.

So when you go create an access sequence.

You put condition tables in access sequence, right?

Currently, the number of condition tables you can put is limited to 99.

Although you never do it.

Going forward In S four Hana that number has been changed to 9993 digits.

Same thing with pricing.

When you go to the pricing calculation schema or procedure.

There is something called as a counter, right?

Right before the condition type.

That has been extended to three digits.

So if you go to K0/NV0.

Go to condition type.

Access sequences.

And pick any access sequence.

Go to excesses.

And this is the one that I was talking about.

If you go to new entries.

Earlier, this was only two digits.

Now this is three digits.

All right.

So that's the change in access sequence.

The other change is in the pricing procedure itself.

So again, once again when you go to zero.

Go to any pricing procedure.

That's fine.

Select that.

Click on control.

The counter here is two digits typically.

But in S4 Hana, this has been changed to three digits.

So you can go up to nine, nine nine.

So this has been changed from two digits.

To three digits.

The third change is the document pricing procedure.

And customer pricing procedure is now.

P digits.

Earlier it was only one digit.

Remember when we had to create a new customer pricing procedure or a document pricing procedure A to

Z and 1 to 9 were mostly taken and you had to struggle for those special characters, right?

Now.

It's easy.

So go to document.

Document pricing procedure and then if you click maintain.

Go to new entries and then you see it can go up to two digits.

So that is one change with respect to document pricing procedure.

Same thing in customer pricing procedure.

Go.

This can go up to two digits.

It can be characters, it can be digits, whatever you like.

So is now two digits.

So that's the third change.

The fourth change, or rather a post-processing step is every time you do this migration, this is a

one time activity anyway for any system.

So when you migrate your system from ECC to S four Hana.

For this pricing condition records.

Write this thing to work properly.

There is a post processing program.

The name of the program is PRC.

Underscore migration.

MiG underscore post underscore processing.

To the document condition data.

This data is already migrated from envato elements as part of the migration so you don't have to do

anything extra.

You don't have to do anything around it.

But this since this is a time consuming process.

Some of the fields, like the document currency, et cetera, are not properly set.

In order to do that, what you have to do is run this program.

And this is going to take some time depending on the number of pricing elements and documents that you

have.

We have a billion documents.

Yeah, it's going to take quite some time.

And in order for the migration itself to not take as long.

That process has been cut short in the actual migration itself and this additional post-processing program

has been provided.

So if you go to eight.

So go to this program PRC underscore migration underscore post.

Post-Processing and execute it.

Right.

So when you run this without test mode.

Here is what is happening.

As of now, there is nothing.

This is not a system that was migrated from ECC to S four Hana.

This is a straight S four Hana system.

So you would not have any entries here.

But if you had migrated from ECC to S four Hana, you'd have a log here that says so many elements have

been processed from CNV to PCD, underscore elements.

And this is the chunk size, this is the delta, so on and so forth.

It's just a mandatory program that has to be run as part of the post-processing after you have migrated

from ECC to S four Hana.

And it's a one time activity.

You don't have to run it again and again.

You can run it any time after the migration has happened.

The technical migration.

That's it.

These are the key changes in pricing that you should be aware of.

Either for an consultant or for an consultant.
