# Consistent User Experience in SAP Fiori

## Introduction
Consistency is a key feature of SAP Fiori applications, ensuring a uniform user experience across different apps.

## Key Concepts

### SAP UI5 Framework
- **Technology**: SAP Fiori apps and custom apps are built using SAP UI5.
  - **Open Source**: Based on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  - **Popularity**: Promoted by SAP, though other competing technologies can be used within the Fiori framework.

### Consistent Interface Design
- **Uniform Layout**: Similar interface design across different applications.
  - **Example**: Manage Sales Orders and Manage Purchase Orders screens.
    - **Search Bar**: Located at the top.
    - **List of Items**: Displayed below the search bar.
    - **Action Buttons**: Consistently placed and styled.

### Example: Sales Orders vs. Purchase Orders
- **Manage Sales Orders**:
  - Search for orders at the top.
  - List of orders displayed below.
  - Actions like creating or managing orders available at the bottom or specific locations.
- **Manage Purchase Orders**:
  - Similar layout with search bar, list of items, and action buttons.

### Consistent UI Elements
- **Buttons**: Consistent color, location, and size.
- **Overlays and Popups**: Uniform design for search popups and other overlays.

## Future Direction
- **Web-Based UI**: SAP Fiori is the future of SAP's UI strategy.
- **No More SAP GUI**: In the S/4HANA world, companies will not build GUI-based apps.
  - No more custom reports in GUI.
  - No more dialog programming in GUI.
- **User-Friendly**: Fiori provides a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Conclusion
SAP Fiori ensures a consistent and modern user experience across different applications. This consistency reduces the learning curve for users and enhances overall usability. As companies transition to S/4HANA, Fiori will become the standard for developing new applications, aligning with SAP's goal of simplifying enterprise software and improving user productivity.



Well, the third feature is consistency.

So all three apps that you see or any custom apps that your company is going to build is going to be

based on.

A framework of technology called UI file.

You can just go Google it.

SAP UI five.

It's an open source Web technology.

Based on HTML, JavaScript CSS.

And you don't have to necessarily use that in theory.

There are many competing technologies that can use in the theory framework, but this is the most popular

one because it's promoted by SAP.

Now, let me go back and say.

Go to the purchase order screen.

Oh, let me just go to the manage sales order screen.

See the interface is consistent.

So you have a search on the top and then a list.

If you go click on Go, it gives you a list of orders.

And then.

Select an order and then you can have certain actions to perform or you can have some actions at the

bottom.

Like create sales order, for example.

This interface is typically consistent.

Now you want to go see how purchase orders are managed.

Let's go.

To purchase order management.

What is that?

Purchase Order Processing.

Right, manage purchase orders.

And you see, it's very similar, right?

You got to search on the top and then the list and then you can select items and any actions that you

perform can be listed there on the top.

Right.

Like here, buttons can be placed here and then some actions can be listed here.

The copy and create.

And these buttons are also very consistent.

You know, the way the button is colored, the way the button is located, the way the button is sized,

the overlays, the search popups, they're all consistent.

You can see that by going to how a sales order is managed versus how a PO is managed purchase orders.

Very consistent user interface.

So in my opinion, these are the three defining factors of theory that differentiate theory apps from

the standard apps.

All right.

So don't worry too much about theory.

If you don't understand it, that's fine.

As we go forward, we'll explore more theory apps and try and compare how theory compares with the standard

apps.

So we're going to talk about customer master, create purchase orders, create sales orders, manage

sales orders to a whole host of things in theory.

And I'll tell you how to add rolls to make those apps visible on your screen.

What kind of adjustments needs to be done in the services framework, so on and so forth.

For now, just understand that theory is.

ASAP is a new web based, responsive and role based UI.

This is the way going forward.

So in the future, in the S four Hana world, companies will not be building GUI or standard SAP GUI

based apps.

No more custom reports in GUI.

No more dialog programming in GUI.

Everything will be based on theory and it's easier on the eye for the users.
