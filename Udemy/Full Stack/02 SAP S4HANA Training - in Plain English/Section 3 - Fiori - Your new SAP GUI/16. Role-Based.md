# Role-Based Applications in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
SAP Fiori introduces a role-based approach to application design, simplifying user interfaces by tailoring them to specific user roles.

## Key Concepts

### Traditional SAP GUI Applications
- **Complexity**: Traditional applications like sales orders or purchase orders contain extensive information.
- **User Needs**: Not all users need access to all information. For example:
  - **Order Creators**: Need detailed information to create orders.
  - **Order Managers**: Only need to manage orders, such as checking status or performing specific actions.

### Role-Based Approach in SAP Fiori
- **Simplified Interfaces**: Tailored to the specific needs of different user roles.
- **Example**: 
  - **Managing Sales Orders**: Users can perform actions like rejecting line items or placing delivery blocks without navigating through complex screens.

## Benefits of Role-Based Applications

### Efficiency
- **Fewer Steps**: Tasks require fewer steps to complete.
- **Example**: Placing a delivery block directly from the order management screen.

### Minimal Screen Changes
- **Consistency**: Users stay on a single screen with automatic data refreshes.
- **Modern Design**: Similar to modern web applications like Facebook or Gmail.

### User-Friendly
- **Intuitive Actions**: Actions are more intuitive and accessible.
- **Example**: Managing sales orders without needing to see all creation fields.

## Practical Examples

### Managing Purchase Orders
- **Create Purchase Order**: Simplified process for creating purchase orders.
- **Manage Purchase Orders**: Separate app for managing purchase orders with limited actions.

### Managing Sales Orders
- **Search and Actions**: Search for orders and perform actions like rejecting items or setting delivery blocks without entering the order details.

## Future Direction
- **Web-Based UI**: SAP is pushing companies to adopt the new web-based UI.
- **Continuous Development**: SAP will continue to build new role-based apps to enhance user productivity.

## Conclusion
Role-based applications in SAP Fiori simplify user interfaces by focusing on the specific needs of different user roles. This approach reduces complexity, saves time, and enhances overall user productivity, aligning with SAP S/4HANA's goal of making enterprise software more accessible and user-friendly.



DIY apps.

The SAP apps.

Are typically complex.

If you look at a sales order or a purchase order, the screen is so big that there's so much of information,

but not everybody needs all that information.

Well, a person creating an order.

Yeah, they do need it.

But a person managing a sales order or a purchase order does not need all that information.

Right.

They just want to look at the status.

They want to look at maybe doing some actions on that order, like rejecting line items or reject the

entire order.

Put a block on the order, check the credit status of the order.

Currently, if you want to do it in the SAP GUI, for example, put a delivery block on the sales order.

What's the way to do it?

You go to zero to sales order change.

Open the order.

Go inside it with all the data and all the complexity.

Go to the header.

Put a delivery block.

Right.

Fury has taken a different approach.

It calls it role based.

If your role is not to create a sales order, but to just manage sales orders, why do you want to show

all the data in a sales order to that user?

It's not just about compliance.

It's about the look and feel of what you see on the screen.

A person creating a sales order is used to look at that screen with all those elements, so it makes

sense that he's given that screen.

But a person managing sales orders does not need to look at all that data.

So he needs a smaller and simpler app that's not really intimidating because that is his role.

So let me submit this sales order.

So purchase order for 5008 created.

You can copy that.

And let's go back to the main screen.

And that was create purchase order, right?

Now you can change the purchase order.

You can view your purchase order items or you can manage purchase orders.

That's a separate app.

Let's click on manage purchase orders.

This was the order that we just created, right?

For purchase orders.

These actions are not very intuitive because the app that's currently built by SAP has limited set of

actions here.

All it does is open.

Now let's go to sales order processing.

Now I want to show you an app called Manage Sales Orders.

So click on that and you can search based on order number sold to party.

So on and so forth.

I've created some orders for Sold to Party 12.

Let me go and see if I can pull them.

Yeah, I got them.

So G Aerospace and the latest order I've created is order number five.

So select that.

And then you see you can perform certain actions.

Reject all items.

You don't have to go into the order.

Select all the line items and then click put a reason for rejection and do all those steps.

Instead you can do that action.

Even before going into the sales order or set a delivery block, remove delivery block set building

blocks.

This is managing the sales order, not creating or changing the sales order in the traditional sense.

Well, we are changing the sales order, but not going into it.

Well, you might argue, what is the difference?

The difference is that a person managing a sales order need not create a sales order.

Right.

If he's not creating a sales order.

Why do you want to show him all the fields in the sales order that he doesn't want to see?

He just wants to put a delivery block on that order.

That's it.

Right.

So this is called role based apps creating simpler and smaller apps that are not intimidating.

And we show the user just what he needs to see.

And another important aspect is less number of steps.

Now, to put a delivery block, you don't have to open the order, go to the header, select the right

tab and put a delivery block.

Just select that order and put a delivery block.

What kind of block bottleneck material?

Okay, so the person managing orders in the company need not have to go inside the sales order and put

that block every time.

All right.

So that was putting delivery blocks.

So it saves time because he has to do less number of steps.

And another thing is screen changes, minimal screen changes.

You don't have to really go back and forth.

The screen refreshes automatically.

We have seen that during sales order creation or purchase order creation, right.

As soon as you enter data, things are automatically refreshed behind the scenes.

That's the new Facebook kind of website, right?

It's one screen like Gmail, and then everything is right there.

You don't have to go back and forth, at least not a lot.

Right now.

Don't expect a lot in these versions, the current versions.

But SAP is going to change and build new apps going forward like crazy.

Because it's pushing companies to use this new web based UI going forward.

So.

We know what's responsive and we have just seen what role based means.

And in role based.

We have discussed how apps are role based and why apps.

The typical standard apps are more complex.

So this saves time because there are less number of steps to perform.

It has minimal.

Screen changes and it is simpler.

Remember one of the goals of SAP s four Hana or the main goal of S four Hana is to make things simple

and role based apps play in to that.
