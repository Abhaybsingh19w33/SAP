# The Next Generation GUI for SAP

## Introduction
In the previous chapter, we explored a key feature of SAP S/4HANA: the removal of aggregate tables. We created a sales order and observed that some aggregate tables are no longer physical tables. This chapter introduces another significant aspect of SAP S/4HANA: the new user interface (UI) called Fiori.

## What is Fiori?
1. **Definition**:
    - Fiori is the next generation of UI for SAP.
    - It represents a modern, web-based interface designed to enhance the user experience.

2. **Background**:
    - Traditional SAP GUI has remained largely unchanged since the 1980s and 1990s.
    - Despite being functional and efficient, the traditional GUI has not kept pace with modern UI standards.

## Evolution of User Interfaces
1. **Web Applications**:
    - The rise of sophisticated web applications has set new standards for user experiences.
    - Example: Gmail's user-friendly interface on the browser.

2. **Mobile Apps**:
    - The proliferation of mobile apps on iOS and Android devices has further influenced UI expectations.
    - Modern apps offer intuitive and seamless user experiences.

## Fiori in SAP S/4HANA
1. **Enhanced Experience**:
    - Fiori takes the user experience to a new level in SAP S/4HANA.
    - It is designed to replace the traditional SAP GUI with a more modern interface.

2. **Browser-Based Interface**:
    - Fiori is entirely browser-based, aligning with contemporary web standards.
    - It provides a consistent and intuitive user experience across devices.

## Fiori Login and Interface
1. **Login Screen**:
    - The new Fiori login screen replaces the traditional SAP logon pad.
    - Users enter their credentials and log in to access the Fiori interface.

2. **User Interface**:
    - The Fiori interface is designed for modern user interactions.
    - SAP has developed a library of 7,000 apps based on standard SAP functionality.

## Standard Functionality in Fiori
1. **Examples of Standard Functionality**:
    - Creation of sales orders.
    - Creation of purchase orders.
    - Customer Master and Material Master management.

2. **Apps in Fiori**:
    - Standard SAP transactions are reimagined as apps in the Fiori environment.
    - These apps provide a more intuitive and efficient way to perform standard tasks.

## Next Steps
1. **Dedicated Chapter on Fiori**:
    - The next chapter will cover Fiori in more detail.
    - Topics will include Fiori architecture, functional specifications, and testing.

## Conclusion
- Fiori is the new, modern UI for SAP S/4HANA, designed to enhance the user experience.
- It replaces the traditional SAP GUI with a browser-based interface.
- Stay tuned for the next chapter to learn more about Fiori and its capabilities.


In the previous chapter, we did a small hands on to explore the key feature of SAP s four Hana.

Removal of aggregates.

We have created a sales order.

We've seen.

That some of the aggregate tables are no longer really aggregate tables.

So that's s four Hana.

There is another equally key ingredient to s four Hana.

And that's the new refreshed UI.

It's called theory.

F i.

O r i.

Some of you might already have an understanding of theory because you might have used theory to some

extent.

In any of your previous projects.

Well, if you have a Hana database, you can use Fiori, but with S four Hana.

Fury is being taken to a new level.

And for those of you who do not understand what theory is.

Fury is the next generation of UI for SAP.

What do I mean by that?

Well, as functional consultants, we are all aware that the way you interact with ASAP is via the ASAP

guy.

We all know how the SAP works.

The look and feel, the user experience, so on and so forth.

And this is an interface that has been developed well in the 1980s and 90s.

Not many of us have worked on SAP in the 1990s.

But there has been very minimal changes to the guy all along.

Most of the elements of the SAP GUI have remained unchanged and believe me, it works well.

It's a very good UI.

It's pretty fast, pretty pleasing to the eyes.

But over the years, especially the last ten years, things have changed.

There are two things primarily that have happened.

One is.

Great new websites, the web or the browser has changed everything.

The way we interact with Gmail, for example.

It's a great user interface with mail on the browser.

Right?

And another thing is apps and websites these days are trying to compete with apps, apps on your iPhone,

apps on your Android.

These changes are based off of new user experiences.

And SAP has built a whole new interface completely based on the browser.

That's based on a new user experiences.

Want to see it in action.

Let's see how the new interface looks like.

So this is the new login screen.

It's equivalent to the SAP logon pad.

Right.

You enter your user ID password.

That's it.

Click.

Log on.

All right.

So this is the new interface.

This is how.

Users going forward are going to consume content.

As of now, SAP has built a library of 7000 apps based on the standard functionality.

What do I mean by standard functionality?

Creation of sales Order.

Creation of purchase Order.

Customer Master.

Material Master.

All of that stuff.

The standard SAP.

Easy Access Transactions.

They're all built as apps in the new world.

New theory world.

We're going to have a dedicated chapter on theory to understand the architecture and how you, as a

functional consultant will interact with theory and going forward, create functional specs, do testing

on theory.

For now, I just want to introduce you to this new UI called theory.
