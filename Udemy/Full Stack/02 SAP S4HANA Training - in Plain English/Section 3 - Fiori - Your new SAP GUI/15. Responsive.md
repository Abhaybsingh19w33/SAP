# Responsive Design in SAP Fiori

## Introduction
Modern design principles emphasize the importance of responsive and adaptive user interfaces. SAP Fiori is designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Key Aspects of Responsive Design

### Adaptive/Responsive Design
Responsive design ensures that applications adapt to different devices and screen sizes, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

#### Example Scenarios
1. **Leave Approval**: 
   - Traditional: Manager logs into SAP on a desktop or laptop to approve leave.
   - Modern: Manager can approve leave on any device with a browser.

2. **Sales Order Confirmation**: 
   - Traditional: Sales rep logs into the system to create an order.
   - Modern: Sales rep can confirm orders on any device with a browser.

### SAP Fiori's Responsiveness
SAP Fiori's UI5 framework automatically adjusts the layout and elements of an application to fit different screen sizes and orientations.

#### Demonstration
1. **Desktop/Laptop View**:
   - Full form factor with all elements displayed.

2. **Mobile View (iPhone)**:
   - The same application adjusts to fit within the smaller screen size.
   - Elements rearrange themselves to fit the vertical layout.

3. **Tablet View (iPad)**:
   - Application adjusts to both portrait and landscape modes.

### Testing Responsiveness
Use browser developer tools to test how an application looks on various devices:
1. Press `F12` to open developer tools.
2. Toggle the device toolbar to switch between different form factors (e.g., iPhone, iPad).

## Conclusion
Responsive design is a fundamental aspect of SAP Fiori, ensuring that applications are accessible and functional on any device. The UI5 framework handles the adjustments automatically, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience across all form factors.



So this is based on modern design principles.

So there are three main aspects of this guy.

First thing is that it's adaptive or responsive.

What do I mean by responsive?

Think of the situation.

An employee in the company has applied for a leave and the manager should approve.

Leave.

And what do you do in the current world?

The manager either has to log in to SAP on his desktop or laptop.

It could be Mac or Windows and then select his workflow or go to the app and approve his leave.

Right.

A sales order has been created and the sales rep is waiting on the customer.

The customer calls and says, Yes, I'm confirming my order.

And what does the sales rep do?

He goes, logs into the system, go to zero one, create an order.

But the world has changed a lot, isn't it?

People no longer use desktops or laptops the way they have been using them for the past ten years.

It's a mobile world.

So does the guy that you know of work on the mobile.

Well, there are some tweaks and hacks, but overall it doesn't.

Right.

But the new UI theory.

Is designed to work responsively on any browser.

The browser on your laptop browser, on your desktop browser, on your Android browser, on your iPhone.

Anytime, anywhere you have a browser, you can use that app.

Right now, what you see on the screen is fury.

On a laptop or a desktop write with full form factor.

I just want to show you that this works equally well on an iPhone or an iPad.

Well, what's the difference between a desktop and an iPhone?

It's the form factor, right?

An iPhone is just four inches across or five inches across.

So the entire application has to work within the confines of that little rectangle.

Right.

An iPad may be a little larger, but still, it's not the equivalent of a desktop or a laptop.

Right.

So let's pick an app.

And the way you pick an app is very simple.

It's like how you pick a tile on your iOS or Android, for example.

What do you want to do?

We want to create, let's say, for a change.

Let's go to purchasing.

Right.

Purchase order.

Processing.

All right.

And create purchase order.

That was easy, isn't it?

And then it lists out a bunch of info records based on which you can create purchase orders.

So say I want to create an order based on that.

And click on Create on the bottom right corner.

Now, since you are looking at this for the first time.

You know, you might not understand where the buttons are or what the search is.

We'll get to that in a bit.

So create.

And here is your new purchase order screen.

Right.

It's not much different from what you see in the sap gui.

Just a little bit pretty.

You got your supplier or vendor and then company code currency, uh, purchase org.

This is all the stuff that you enter at the header of your purchase order.

Then you enter materials.

Quantities and the plant where you want to create it.

Right.

For example, I want to create it in 1060.

All right.

And, uh, I want the company code to be 1060 as well.

And, uh, what else?

I think that should do.

But there's a net price, right?

Go enter a net price.

Say $100.

Right now.

This is your purchase order screen that you would look at in a full fledged desktop or laptop.

How would this look like on your iPhone?

Well in the browser any browser chrome Internet Explorer.

There is a functionality where you can see the different form factors of the same website.

What I have done is just hit F12 on my keyboard and then.

Click on this button.

This toggles the form factor to different devices.

Right.

So click on that.

This is your regular full size.

Click on that again.

And then you have.

Uh, say an iPhone six.

Okay, so this is the form factor for an iPhone six, and this is how your website is going to look

like.

Your purchase order screen on an iPhone six.

Cool, isn't it?

The same screen that was spread out horizontally is now vertical.

And that happens automatically.

You don't have to build your app for that.

The framework called Ui5 that SAP Fiori is based on is responsive.

And when I mean responsive, it's this.

Adjustment of the different elements on the screen to different form factors.

Form Factors.

Meaning sizes.

Length and width.

If the length and width changes the way the elements on the screen that are displayed have to rearrange

themselves.

When an app or a website does that automatically, that website is called responsive.

So theory is based on a responsive framework.

So all apps work on all form factors, and that's by default.

You don't have to do anything for that.

You don't have to code it, you know, in a particular way to make it work on an iPhone or a desktop.

The framework.

Like I said, UI five.

That's the technology behind it.

Is, by default, responsive.

Now, this is an iPhone six, right?

So you can do the same things that you that you do on your desktop, right?

All the buttons are here.

And then there's a search here.

Right.

It's pretty intuitive.

You have been using your iPhone all along, right?

And it works absolutely fine this way.

And you can you can navigate around easily.

You don't need to be trained on that.

Right?

It's so easy.

You want to see it on a different form factor, say an iPad.

This is how it would look on an iPad.

Maybe in portrait mode, but in landscape mode, this is how it would look like, right?

You rotate it and then it goes to landscape mode.

And this is how the app would look like.

And this is all inbuilt into theory.

Right.

So, so one of the key features of the theory UI is.

It's responsive.

The second key feature is that it's role based.

What do I mean by role based?
