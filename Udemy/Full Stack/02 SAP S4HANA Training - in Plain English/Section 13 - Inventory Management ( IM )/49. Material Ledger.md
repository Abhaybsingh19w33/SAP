# Material Ledger

## Introduction
The provided text discusses the concept of the Material Ledger within SAP S/4HANA. The Material Ledger is a core concept in controlling, primarily used for the valuation of materials. It has existed even before SAP S/4HANA and is not something logistics consultants need to configure, as this is typically handled by controlling consultants. The Material Ledger offers two main advantages: valuation of materials in multiple currencies and more accurate costing.

## Advantages of the Material Ledger

### 1. Valuation in Multiple Currencies
One of the primary reasons for using the Material Ledger is to enable the valuation of materials in multiple currencies. This is particularly beneficial for companies operating in different countries with different currencies.

#### Example
- **Indian Oil Company**: Company code currency is Indian Rupees (INR), but stock needs to be valued in US Dollars (USD) because oil is globally traded in USD.
- **Benefit**: Allows visibility of stock in both INR and USD, crucial for financial reporting and decision-making.

### 2. More Accurate Costing
Traditional inventory management in SAP ECC uses standard price or moving average price for material valuation, which can lead to discrepancies between the inventory value in the balance sheet and the actual procurement cost recorded in accounts payable. The Material Ledger addresses this issue by providing real-time costing.

#### Example
- **Purchase Order**: Created with an expected price.
- **Goods Receipt (GR)**: Records inventory at the expected price.
- **Invoice Receipt (IR)**: Actual price might differ due to various factors.
- **Discrepancy**: Between inventory value in the balance sheet and accounts payable.
- **Material Ledger**: Automatically reconciles these differences at the end of the month, eliminating the need for manual adjustments.

## Material Ledger in SAP S/4HANA
In SAP S/4HANA, the Material Ledger is mandatory and serves as the only ledger for costing and valuation. While the valuation in multiple currencies is a required feature, the costing aspect is optional but highly beneficial.

### Features
- **Valuation in Multiple Currencies**: Essential for global operations.
- **Real-Time Costing**: Ensures profit and loss account and balance sheet are always in sync regarding material valuation.

## Summary
The Material Ledger in SAP S/4HANA provides significant advantages in material valuation and costing. It allows for valuation in multiple currencies and ensures real-time reconciliation of inventory values, enhancing the accuracy of financial reporting. Although logistics consultants do not need to configure the Material Ledger, understanding its benefits and functionality is crucial for effective inventory management and financial control.

## Additional Explanation

### Valuation in Multiple Currencies
Material Ledger allows valuation in up to three currencies, beneficial for companies dealing with multiple currencies.

### Costing
Material Ledger provides real-time costing, ensuring that the profit and loss account and the balance sheet are always in sync regarding material valuation.

#### Example
- **Standard Cost of Coffee**: $10 per pound.
- **Purchase Order**: 100 pounds at $10 per pound ($1,000 total).
- **Goods Receipt (GR)**: Inventory valued at $1,000.
- **Invoice Receipt (IR)**: Actual price is $8 per pound ($800 total).
- **Discrepancy**: Balance sheet shows $1,000, accounts payable shows $800.
- **Material Ledger**: Automatically reconciles the $200 difference at the end of the month.

### Implementation in SAP S/4HANA
- **Mandatory**: Material Ledger is mandatory in SAP S/4HANA.
- **Configuration**: Handled by controlling consultants.
- **Transaction**: `Start` transaction used to get the company code ready from a Material Ledger perspective.

### Conclusion
Material Ledger is a crucial functionality in SAP S/4HANA, providing valuation in multiple currencies and real-time costing. It ensures accurate financial reporting and eliminates discrepancies between the balance sheet and profit and loss account.

This structured format provides a clear and concise overview of the key concepts and advantages of the Material Ledger within SAP S/4HANA, making it easier to understand and follow.


The provided text discusses the concept of the Material Ledger within SAP S/4HANA. The Material Ledger is a core concept in controlling, primarily used for the valuation of materials. It has existed even before SAP S/4HANA and is not something logistics consultants need to configure, as this is typically handled by controlling consultants. The Material Ledger offers two main advantages: valuation of materials in multiple currencies and more accurate costing.

One of the primary reasons for using the Material Ledger is to enable the valuation of materials in multiple currencies. This is particularly beneficial for companies operating in different countries with different currencies. For example, an Indian oil company might have its company code currency in Indian Rupees (INR) but needs to value its stock in US Dollars (USD) because oil is globally traded in USD. The Material Ledger allows such companies to maintain visibility of their stock in both currencies, which is crucial for financial reporting and decision-making.

The second significant advantage of the Material Ledger is related to costing. Traditional inventory management in SAP ECC uses standard price or moving average price for material valuation, which can lead to discrepancies between the inventory value in the balance sheet and the actual procurement cost recorded in accounts payable. These discrepancies often require manual adjustments through journal entries. The Material Ledger addresses this issue by providing real-time costing, ensuring that the profit and loss account and the balance sheet are always in sync regarding material valuation.

The text provides an example to illustrate the costing advantage of the Material Ledger. When a purchase order is created with an expected price, the goods receipt (GR) records the inventory at this expected price. However, the actual invoice receipt (IR) might have a different price due to various factors. This difference can cause discrepancies between the inventory value in the balance sheet and the accounts payable. The Material Ledger automatically reconciles these differences at the end of the month, eliminating the need for manual adjustments.

In SAP S/4HANA, the Material Ledger is mandatory and serves as the only ledger for costing and valuation. While the valuation in multiple currencies is a required feature, the costing aspect is optional but highly beneficial. Companies are likely to adopt Material Ledger-based costing due to its real-time accuracy and the elimination of discrepancies between financial statements.

In summary, the Material Ledger in SAP S/4HANA provides significant advantages in material valuation and costing. It allows for valuation in multiple currencies, which is essential for global operations, and ensures real-time reconciliation of inventory values, enhancing the accuracy of financial reporting. Although logistics consultants do not need to configure the Material Ledger, understanding its benefits and functionality is crucial for effective inventory management and financial control.


In this section, we'll talk about a concept called material ledger.

This is something that has existed even before.

As for Hannah.

And it's basically a core concept controlling so as consultants or consultants.

Just because you see the word material, you don't have to really worry about it.

Material ledger is a concept whereby the valuation of the material is done in a slightly different way.

There are basically two reasons why a material ledger is used.

The first reason and probably the more simpler reason.

Is valuation.

Of the material.

In multiple currencies.

We're not going to bother about the configuration of material ledger because that's something that your

SEO consultant will do for you.

So as logistics consultant, you don't have to worry about the configuration behind it.

But what you have to understand is there are two distinct advantages with the material ledger.

Just understand the concept behind it.

So valuation of a material in multiple currencies.

Why do you need that?

For example.

Classic example rather is oil companies.

For the US companies, this is not a big deal.

The global currency is USD.

The US currency is used.

The company called currency.

Say think of a company like ONGC or Indian Oil in India.

The company code currency is obviously INR Indian rupees.

But the global currency is USD.

And what's the raw material for Indian Oil Company?

Oil by the barrel and oil by the barrel is sold globally in USD.

What does that mean?

That means.

That at any given point in time because their raw material is predominantly dominated in in a purchasing

currency of USD.

Indian oil always needs to have visibility into their stock or purchases.

In two different currencies.

INR USD.

Well, the reason why you need to maintain or have visibility into the stock in INR is pretty obvious

because that's the company codes currency.

So you need to know how much stock is there in terms of the company codes valuation.

But they also need to know how much stock do they have in terms of US currency, because it's a convenience

factor because that's the predominant currency in which they buy or even sell because they could sell

oil, export oil in USD again.

So having the ability.

To maintain valuation for their stock in multiple currencies is really beneficial from a finance perspective.

And material ledger allows valuation in up to three currencies.

This is the first feature.

Probably a more important feature is related to casting.

This is a complicated concept, but I'm going to explain it very briefly.

Let's take this example.

You don't have to go deep into it.

Just understand what's really happening and the reason why Material Ledger is being used.

Say you're selling coffee.

Okay.

So the standard cost of coffee is set at $1.10 per pound.

Okay.

That's what you started with.

So there's a.

And the PO is sent out to the vendor at ten per pound.

And a quantity of 100.

Right.

So 100 into ten, that is $1,000.

Is the expected price of coffee total.

Now a couple of days.

The gr the goods receipt has happened.

So when the gr or goods receipt happens, there is no price.

Right.

It's just quantity.

How much quantity?

Say the entire 100 quantity has come in.

And how much is the value of the goods now that lies in inventory?

100 into the expected price.

$1,000.

Right.

So $1,000 worth of inventory now, because it's been received is sitting as an asset where.

It's sitting as an asset in the balance sheet.

Because asset.

Stays in the balance sheet.

Not on the profit and loss account.

Now an invoice receipt happens.

Right and watch it as it happens in a couple of days.

And that's when the vendor comes up with the actual price.

The vendor is going to say the price is going to be $9.5 or $10.5.

That depends on a variety of factors.

Why did the price change?

The price could change because of seasonality.

The price could change because of the nature of the product or nature of the market or nature of the

transaction itself.

The expected price is not precisely the same as the actual price.

There are slight variations just for convenience.

We're going to set it at $1 eight per pound.

That's a huge variation.

But still, I just want to make my math easy again for the quantity of 100.

So.

The price is going to be $800.

Right.

That's what we are paying the vendor.

And that's not an asset, right?

It's a payable accounts payable.

Where does that sit?

That sits in your.

You see what's happening here?

Your says that the total cost of procurement so far is $800, but your balance sheet says that there's

$1,000 worth of inventory.

This is the classic problem with the standard inventory management valuations that we have in SAP.

What are they?

You have two types, right?

Standard price or standard cost.

A moving average.

In either of these cases, there is always going to be a disconnect between balance sheet and.

So when there is an audit, what people do or in general at the end of the quarter, the end of the

month or whatever, people in casting or finance do a journal entry.

A manual journal entry to ensure that these values tally.

To get to that difference is very difficult.

You know, you have to run programs, get to that difference, use your algorithms and get that value

in the material ledger.

If you use the material ledger at the end of the month.

These differences are synced automatically.

You don't have to do it manually.

This is one of the key advantages of material ledger.

Real costing as opposed to.

Estimated costing.

This ensures that your profit and loss and balance sheet always stay in sync in terms of costing.

Now, again, like I said, for a logistics consultant, this is not a worry.

All you have to do is there is a every time a new plant is created, your controlling consultant will

go run a transaction called Start.

And that will get that company code ready from a material ledger perspective.

That's it.

You don't have to do anything else.

So just to recap, Material Ledger is a functionality is a concept.

That's available even before s four Hana.

But in S four Hana it's mandatory to use the material ledger.

Material ledger is now the only ledger.

Let's use used for casting and valuation in SAP.

What are the features of the material ledger?

The first feature is that valuation is done in multiple currencies.

We have seen the advantages of evaluating simultaneously in multiple currencies.

The second feature is casting.

Now valuation is a required.

You don't have to evaluate it in multiple currencies, but you have the facility and costing.

Is optional.

You don't have to use the material Azure based costing.

You can choose not to do it.

As an optional feature, but a very, very coveted feature.

Companies require that.

And because in s four Hana material ledger has been made mandatory.

Probably you'll see more companies starting to use costing based on the material ledger, which is more

real time.

And we have seen the advantages of how.

With the material ledger.

The differences in the cost or valuation between profit and loss account and balance sheet account for

materials or stocks is synced, which does not happen in EK with the standard price or moving average

based costing.
