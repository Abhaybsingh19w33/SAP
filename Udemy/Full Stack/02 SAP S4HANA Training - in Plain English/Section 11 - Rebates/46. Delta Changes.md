# Delta Changes in Rebates

## Introduction
The provided text discusses the changes in the handling of rebates within SAP S/4HANA, specifically the transition from the traditional method used in SAP ECC to a new approach using Settlement Management.

## Traditional Rebates in SAP ECC
Rebates in SAP ECC are a functionality within the Sales and Distribution (SD) and Materials Management (MM) modules, where discounts and bonuses are given retroactively as a lump sum rather than immediately off the invoice.

### Example Scenarios
- **Sales Rebate**: A customer might receive a 2% cash back if they purchase $100,000 worth of goods within a certain period.
- **Purchasing Rebate**: The exact reverse happens on the purchasing end in P2P.

## Changes in SAP S/4HANA

### Transition to Settlement Management
In SAP S/4HANA, the process for handling rebates has shifted from using standard transactions to a new module called Settlement Management. This change is similar to how credit management in SD has moved to Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM).

### Reasons for the Shift
The shift addresses some of the limitations and issues associated with the traditional method, such as the reliance on index tables like VBOX.

#### VBOX Table in SAP ECC
- **Function**: Maintains pointers to all documents where rebates can be applied, regardless of whether the rebates have been applied or not.
- **Issues**: Index tables like VBOX can create problems related to concurrency and table locking, making retroactive rebate processing difficult.

### Elimination of Index Tables
With the power of the HANA database in SAP S/4HANA, the need for index tables is eliminated. The faster database allows for on-the-fly processing, directly accessing documents and applying rebates without relying on an index table.

### Settlement Management Module
The new module, Settlement Management, handles all aspects of rebates and other related functionalities. This module is more comprehensive and capable of managing complex scenarios beyond just rebates.

## Detailed Explanation

### Retroactive Rebate Processing
- **Scenario**: Rebates can be created after the fact that sales have happened and the invoice has been created.
- **Example**: A customer requests that all orders created in previous months be included in the rebate calculation.

#### Traditional Method in SAP ECC
- **Solution**: SAP maintains an index table called VBOX.
- **Function**: VBOX contains links to all documents where rebates can be applied.
- **Program**: VB F (Retroactive Rebate Processing Program) looks at the index table, checks all invoices that apply to the criteria, and manually applies the rebate.

#### Issues with Index Tables
- **Problems**: Index tables create problems in terms of concurrency, table locking, and other technical issues.

### New Approach in SAP S/4HANA
- **Elimination of VBOX**: The VBOX table is no longer relevant for new rebates.
- **Direct Access**: SAP can directly go to any document or invoice and apply the rebate using the power of the HANA database.
- **Process**: The process of applying and settling rebates remains the same, but the underlying mechanism has changed.

### Settlement Management Module
- **Functionality**: Handles all aspects of rebates and other related functionalities.
- **Scope**: Deals with more complicated scenarios beyond just rebates.

## Conclusion
The transition to Settlement Management in SAP S/4HANA provides a more efficient and flexible approach to handling rebates, eliminating the need for index tables and taking advantage of the faster processing capabilities of the HANA database. This change is part of a broader effort to improve the overall functionality and performance of the system.

### Where to Find Settlement Management
- **Location**: Logistics > Settlement Management
- **Function**: Create new rebate contracts and settle those rebate contracts either partially or fully in SAP S/4HANA.



The provided text discusses the changes in the handling of rebates within SAP S/4HANA, specifically the transition from the traditional method used in SAP ECC to a new approach using Settlement Management.

Rebates in SAP ECC are a functionality within the Sales and Distribution (SD) and Materials Management (MM) modules, where discounts and bonuses are given retroactively as a lump sum rather than immediately off the invoice. For example, a customer might receive a 2% cash back if they purchase $100,000 worth of goods within a certain period. This rebate is not applied to each invoice individually but is accumulated over time and settled once the total purchase amount reaches the agreed threshold.

In SAP S/4HANA, the process for handling rebates has shifted from using standard transactions to a new module called Settlement Management. This change is similar to how credit management in SD has moved to Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM). The reason for this shift is to address some of the limitations and issues associated with the traditional method, such as the reliance on index tables like VBOX.

The VBOX table in SAP ECC maintains pointers to all documents where rebates can be applied, regardless of whether the rebates have been applied or not. This table allows for retroactive rebate processing, where rebates can be applied to past transactions based on certain criteria. However, index tables like VBOX can create problems related to concurrency and table locking, making retroactive rebate processing difficult.

With the power of the HANA database in SAP S/4HANA, the need for index tables is eliminated. The faster database allows for on-the-fly processing, directly accessing documents and applying rebates without relying on an index table. As a result, the VBOX table is no longer relevant for new rebates, although older rebates can still be processed and settled.

The new module, Settlement Management, handles all aspects of rebates and other related functionalities. This module is more comprehensive and capable of managing complex scenarios beyond just rebates. While the process of applying and settling rebates remains the same, the underlying mechanism has changed to leverage the capabilities of the HANA database.

In summary, the transition to Settlement Management in SAP S/4HANA provides a more efficient and flexible approach to handling rebates, eliminating the need for index tables and taking advantage of the faster processing capabilities of the HANA database. This change is part of a broader effort to improve the overall functionality and performance of the system.



In this section, we'll talk about the replacement for rebates.

So rebates is a functionality in SD and RM.

Whereby.

You give discounts and bonuses?

Not off of the invoice right away, but retroactively as a lump sum.

Example You could have an agreement with your customer that says in the context of sales, that says.

If you buy $100,000 worth of goods from me, I'm going to give you a 2% cash back.

One example.

Another example, if you buy $100,000.

Worth of electronics from me.

Within six months, I'm going to give you 3% cash back.

This is a rebate.

You are not going to give that 2% cash back on every invoice.

You're going to accumulate the 2%, 2%, 2%, 2% on every invoice, statistically meaning as a lump

sum, you keep accumulating and finally, until the total value reaches 100,000.

Whereby the 2% of 100,000 is, let us say 2000.

This amount will be settled as a rebate settlement to the customer.

Now the exact reverse happens on the purchasing end in P2P.

So, so far, so good, right?

Everything is there in place.

So what is the change?

The change is that rebates are now processed in S four.

Hana not using the standard transactions of creating rebates, but using a different module kind of

called settlement.

Management, just like the way credit management in SD has moved from SD to FCM.

Rebates have now moved to a different module called Settlement management.

The obvious.

Next question is why.

Let's talk about some scenarios.

Say, for example, one of the common practices in the industry is that rebates are applied retroactively.

Meaning a rebate can be created after the fact that sales have happened and the invoice has been created.

Let me give you some examples.

Say on March 1st.

There is a sales order or invoice, let's say 9000 21 right off of that.

2%.

Based on say, this only applies for gold customer, which is in this case a particular customer based

on customer group.

And it only applies for a particular group of products, say dairy products.

Right.

So this is customer group, this is material group.

And on March 2nd, there is another invoice.

Another 2% keeps accumulating, right?

And the list goes on and on and on.

March, April, May, June, July.

Now the customer comes up and says, How about all my orders that have been created?

In the month of March.

February.

January.

Can you please include that volume as well in calculating my rebates?

Although the agreement has started maybe on March 1st or March 31st.

What about my previous orders?

They are still valid.

Valid orders, right?

What if my rebate needs to start from January 1st?

This is called retroactive rebate processing.

A very important term.

Now SAP has a solution for this already in EC.

What it does is as long as that condition type is there, SAP maintains an index table.

It's called vbox.

The vbox vbox table.

Maintains a pointer.

To all the documents.

Irrespective of the fact whether the rebates have been applied or not.

For example, in the month of February, rebates have not been applied for this customer.

But this table we box.

Contains links to all the documents where rebates can be applied.

So if you go to C11.

Check out the table.

VBox.

VBox.

What do you see here?

You see the rebate condition table called tab number and then the variable key that's used in condition

technique.

Then you have the sales document number in this case, invoice and item number.

Right.

So essentially this is an index to all the invoices along with the variable key, the key based on which

you can apply the rebate.

So this is how the table will look like.

Now.

If you say, for example, if you want to extend this rebate to a previous transaction based on material

group material, customer, group, whatever.

Using this variable key, this table can track all the invoices and items for which the rebate applies.

So using a program called VB F.

Right.

So this is called the retroactive rebate processing program.

What this can do is it can look at the index table.

Check out all the invoices that apply to that criteria for which you want to retroactively process rebates.

Go to the corresponding documents.

In March, February or any previous period.

Go manually apply that rebate.

Essentially reprise.

The document and.

Produce that 2% or 1% or whatever rebate that needs to be accumulated for that document.

And don't worry about this.

Rephrasing so will ensure that the existing price will not change.

It's just that the statistical component for rebate will get added and it will be cumulated.

Right.

So what is the problem here?

Everything is working, right?

The problem is index table.

You know that index tables create problems.

That was the whole premise of S four Hana and why Hana was created as a powerful database that does

not rely on indices.

Right.

So we box as a table.

Will create a lot of problems in terms of concurrency, table locking and all the technical stuff that

basically makes creating retroactive rebates very difficult.

We don't want to get into the details of it, but you understand that index tables cause problems.

Now, you know, with the new power of Hana.

You don't need index tables to go look at all the invoices and the line items.

With the faster database, anything can be done on the fly.

Right.

So vbox table.

Is done away with.

No longer relevant.

At least for new rebates.

So older rebates can still be processed, You can still settle older rebates, but you cannot create

new rebates.

So creation of new rebates.

Using the standard EC rebate creation programs is not possible now.

In Hana.

Right.

Instead, SAP can directly go to any document, any invoice that that should apply this particular kind

of rebate and use retroactive rebate processing.

So process wise, this has not changed, you know.

Rebate is still a rebate.

A rebate needs to be applied.

A document needs to be created.

That specifies that rebate needs to be applied and rebates need to be settled either partially or fully.

So process wise, there is no change.

You still have to find the relevant document and retroactively reprice them.

It's the same technique, but to find these documents, SAP is no longer going to rely on an index table.

Instead, it's going to do it instantly using the power of Hana, but directly going to the document.

Now there is a new module called Settlement Management.

So all of rebates.

Anything new that you want to create is now moved to this new module called Settlement Management.

So you no longer need to work on rebates, as you know, in SEC.

It's all going to be in settlement management.

Now, settlement management deals with a whole lot more complicated things than just rebates.

And it does not just SD rebates.

It does rebates and not just rebates.

Many other things as well.

But if you go to the settlement management is something that we are not going to cover in detail because

it's a it's a separate thing with a whole host of functionality.

And it will take at least, you know, 4 to 6 hours to cover just the basics of settlement management.

But just understand why rebates have been moved away from the standard rebates, as you note, in SEC

and the removal of vbox table.

In case you're wondering where this new module is, go to logistics.

And you see settlement management here, right?

So it is here that you create new rebate contracts and how you settle those rebate contracts either

partially or fully in Sbarro.

This is available in logistics, General.

And under.

Settlement management.

So that's all we're going to cover about rebates.
