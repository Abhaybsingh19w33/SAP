# Credit Segment

## Introduction
In this section, we will discuss the key changes in credit management with the introduction of Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM) in SAP S/4HANA. One of the significant changes is the replacement of the credit control area with the concept of a credit segment.

## Key Changes in Credit Management

### Transition from Credit Control Area to Credit Segment
- **Previous Setup**: Credit control area was the organizational element at which credit limits were maintained.
- **Current Setup**: Credit control area is replaced with a credit segment, which is more useful in global scenarios.

### Understanding Credit Segments
- **Definition**: A credit segment is an organizational element used to maintain credit limits in FSCM.
- **Global Segment**: Allows for the definition of a global credit limit that can be rolled up from local segments.

### Example Scenario
#### Traditional SAP ECC Model
1. **Option 1**: Single Credit Control Area
   - Assign multiple company codes (e.g., US, UK, India) to the same credit control area.
   - Set a collective credit limit (e.g., $100,000) for all company codes.
   
2. **Option 2**: Separate Credit Control Areas
   - Create separate credit control areas for each company code.
   - Set individual credit limits for each company code (e.g., US: $50,000, UK: $30,000, India: $20,000).

#### FSCM Model
1. **Global Segment**
   - Define a global segment with an overall credit limit (e.g., $100,000).
   
2. **Local Segments**
   - Assign company codes to local segments with individual credit limits.
     - US company code assigned to US segment with a $50,000 limit.
     - UK company code assigned to UK segment with a $30,000 limit.
     - India company code assigned to India segment with a $20,000 limit.
   - Local segments can roll up their credit limits into the global segment.

### Advantages of Credit Segments
- **Flexibility**: Allows for the definition of both global and local credit limits.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Enables the roll-up of local credit limits into a global segment, providing better control and visibility.
- **Global Scenarios**: More suitable for managing credit in global business environments.

## Summary
- **Credit Control Area**: Previously used in SAP ECC to manage credit limits.
- **Credit Segment**: Introduced in FSCM, replacing the credit control area with a more flexible and hierarchical approach.
- **Global and Local Segments**: Allows for the definition of global and local credit limits with the ability to roll up local limits into a global segment.


Now, if the process has not changed, what are the key changes?

Now let's talk about the key changes in credit management with FSM in place.

One of the key changes is.

The credit control area.

Is kind of replaced with what is called as a segment or a credit segment.

What is a segment or a credit segment?

Now, this is more useful in global scenarios.

So far an SEC credit control area is the org element at which you maintain credit.

Right.

Go to 32.

You have to enter credit control area.

Go to the configuration.

You have to enter credit control area because that is the key element.

Let me give you an example.

Say GE is a customer.

Right.

GE is a customer for us and we are selling something to GE and JI is a customer in us.

UK and say India.

Now if the credit limit.

Needs to be tracked at each company code level.

Say these are company codes.

US, UK, India.

What do you do?

Option one.

Is that you assign all of these.

To the same credit control area.

And then give a credit limit of, say, 100,000.

This is one option whereby you control the entire credit that's given across all these orgs.

Right.

This is option one, typically.

The option to.

Is where?

You create a separate credit control area for each of the company codes, for example, let me put it

this way Option two.

You have, say zero one as one credit control area, UK zero one as one credit control area and zero

one as one credit control area.

And for each of them, you define a credit limit.

Say this is 50 K, this is 30 K, this is 20 K.

Right.

And these are the two ways in which you can control credit.

In the traditional SEC model.

With FCM, you can have something called as a global segment.

Global.

Segment.

This could be 100,000.

We could set the credit limit for 100,000.

An US company code could be assigned to US zero one segment.

And this could be, like I said, 50 K.

And UK could be assigned to UK zero one segment and this could be given 30 K and in company code will

need to be given as in zero one and this will be given a credit limit of 20 K and we can define that.

These have a parent segment called the global segment.

So this rule up.

Of the credit limits at the company code level into a global segment.

Is something that we cannot do in the typical SEC credit control area based credit management.

So this is one key change.

Remember, so once again, in SEC, there are two options or two ways in which you can define credit

limit.

Option one is where you define credit control area by company code, and multiple company codes could

be associated with one credit control area.

And thereby you control the credit limit across company codes.

Meaning if you want to only avail a credit limit of 100 K, irrespective of where they are doing business.

This is the way to go.

Instead, if you want to have its own individual credits, meaning in US, the company is different,

so you extend a different credit limit.

In UK the company is different.

You extend a different credit limit.

In cases like that.

You create your own credit control areas.

One per company code or.

One for a bunch of company codes like US and UK together can have one credit control area and India

could be different.

With FCM.

They have brought in a concept called segments or credit segments.

You can define a global segment and you can define local segments like one company code against one

segment.

And you can define credit limit.

Now.

At the segment level, which has the facility to roll up to a global segment.

This is something that is not available in credit control area.

This is the key difference.

Rolling up.
