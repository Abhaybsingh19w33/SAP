# Summary

## Introduction
Let's summarize what we have learned in credit management.

## Key Points

### 1. Introduction of Credit Segment
- **Credit Segment vs. Credit Control Area**: Credit segments provide more flexibility compared to credit control areas.

### 2. Risk Scoring
- **Traditional SAP ECC Model**: 
  - Risk scoring is a static activity.
  - Customers are classified as high, medium, or low risk based on ratings from external agencies or their performance.
  - Manual updates are done in transaction FD32.
- **FSCM Model**:
  - Risk scoring can be automated using formulas.
  - Formulas can be based on external credit ratings or internal calculations.

### 3. Integration with External Rating Companies
- **Traditional SAP ECC Model**: 
  - Integration with external rating companies is not available by default.
  - Custom-built features are required for integration.
- **FSCM Model**:
  - Integrated via Process Integration (PI).
  - Formulas can be used to calculate credit limits, credit ratings, and scores based on external feeds.

### 4. Decoupling of SD and FI Modules
- **Traditional SAP ECC Model**: 
  - SD and FI modules are tightly coupled.
- **FSCM Model**:
  - SD and FI modules are decoupled.
  - FSCM is a separate module.

### 5. Optimizations in FSCM
- **External Feeds**: Used to calculate ratings.
- **Formula-Based Scoring**: Allows for dynamic and automated risk scoring.
- **Integration of Credit Management Views into BP**: Credit management views are integrated into the business partner role.
- **Workflow Integration**: Workflows are integrated with credit management.
- **Credit Segments**: Used instead of credit control areas to define credit.

## Conclusion
These optimizations in FSCM make credit management more efficient and effective, providing better flexibility, automation, and integration capabilities.


So let's summarize what we have learned in credit management.

Introduction of credit segment as opposed to credit control area.

What does what does credit segment do?

Gives more flexibility compared to credit control area.

Point number two, risk scoring.

In EQ risk scoring, which means classifying the customer as high risk or low risk or medium risk is

a static activity, meaning you got to look at some rating agency or the performance of the customer

and either degrade him to a lower grade or upgrade him to a better grade manually in hefty 32.

With FCM based credit management.

This scoring.

Can be automated.

With formula.

And this formula could be based on external credit rating.

Or internal calculation.

Third point is integration with external rating companies.

Currently in SEC, we don't have this feature, if at all.

We want to implement it.

It has to be a custom built feature.

In FCM.

This is integrated via Pi or process integration, and you can use formula to calculate whatever you

want credit limits, credit ratings, scoring, any of that stuff.

So basically, if you want me to define the changes in credit management in under one minute.

First point I would say is the decoupling.

Of PSD and are in CC.

This is a very tight couple in FCM psd and are separated together with.

F.

S cm being a separate module.

And second thing is there are some optimizations like.

External feeds to calculate ratings.

Formula based scoring.

Integration of credit management views into BP.

And there is also called something called as workflow that's integrated with credit management.

And there is something called as segments that are used instead of credit control areas to define credit.

And these are all optimizations done in FCM to make credit management even more better.
