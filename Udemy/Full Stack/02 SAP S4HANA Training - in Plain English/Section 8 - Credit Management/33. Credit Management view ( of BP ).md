# Credit Management View (of BP)

## Introduction
In this section, we will discuss how to define and manage credit segments in SAP S/4HANA's Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM) module. This includes the transition from the traditional credit control area to the new credit segment concept and how to maintain credit limits using the business partner (BP) view.

## Defining Credit Segments

### Navigation
1. **Path**: Go to `SPRO > IMG > Financial Supply Chain Management`.
2. **Note**: Credit segments are no longer defined under enterprise structure but as a subfunction of supply chain management.

### Creating Credit Segments
- **Main Credit Segment**: Also referred to as the global credit segment.
- **Sub Segments**: Attach to the main credit segment. You can create multiple main segments and sub-segments based on the level of consolidation required.

## Maintaining Credit Limits

### Navigation
1. **Path**: Go to `Financial Supply Chain Management > Accounting > Credit Management > Master Data`.
2. **Transaction Code**: `UKM_BP` (Credit Management view of the business partner).

### Credit Management View of BP
- **Role**: `UKM0001` (Credit Management role for the business partner).
- **Equivalent**: Replaces the traditional `FD32` transaction used by SD or FI consultants.

### Steps to Maintain Credit Limits
1. **Access BP**: Use `UKM_BP` or navigate to BP and select the `UKM0001` role.
2. **Credit Profile**: Go to the credit profile of the business partner.
3. **Credit Segment Data**: 
   - Set credit limits for specific credit segments.
   - Define validity periods for the credit limits.

### Example Scenario
- **Business Partner**: 119
- **Credit Segments**:
  - **0004 Credit Segment**: Set a credit limit for a specific line of business (e.g., apparel sales, electronics sales).
  - **0001 Credit Segment**: Set a different credit limit for another line of business.

### Advantages of Credit Segments
- **Granular Control**: Allows setting different credit limits for various lines of business within the same company code.
- **Roll-Up Functionality**: Credit limits can be rolled up to the main segment if configured.

## Summary
- **Credit Segments**: Introduced in FSCM, replacing the traditional credit control area with a more flexible and hierarchical approach.
- **UKM0001 Role**: Maintains all credit data within the business partner's credit management view, replacing the `FD32` transaction.
- **Flexibility**: Enables setting different credit limits for various lines of business and rolling up local limits into a global segment.


So where do you define these segments?

Go to Sbarro.

IMG.

And instead of going to enterprise structure, go to financial supply chain management.

So this credit segment is no longer an enterprise structure element.

Instead, it is a subfunction of supply chain management.

So you don't have to define credit segments in enterprise structure.

Instead, you can create them here.

Now, as you can see, there are so many different aspects to financial supply chain management.

Belairdirect consolidation, cash and liquidity management, Treasury management.

So there are many aspects to FCM.

Unlike SD or M, it's a module in itself.

Now, as part of SAP S four Hana migration.

An SD consultant or consultant need not learn SQL.

And they can.

It's a different module with a wide range.

All they have to do is.

Go to credit management and do a couple of settings.

In my case, in my project.

There was a dedicated consultant who took care of the FCM implementation that includes credit management.

So I did not have to do anything except do a couple of settings.

My role mostly was in migrating or assisting the consultant in migrating the existing credit management

settings.

Credit limits.

And all that stuff into FCA.

So coming back to credit segments, this is where you create credit segments.

All right now.

There can be a main credit segment, which I was calling as global credit segment.

So this becomes.

The main.

Credit segment.

So there is one main credit segment.

And then there could be any number of sub segments.

That attach themselves to the main credit segment.

Now you can create as many main segments as you want, depending on how many.

Consolidations you want to maintain, you can create as many main credit segments and underneath that

you could create sub segments.

And like I said, credit management is done at the credit segment level.

Right.

So how do you maintain credit limit?

Go back.

So instead of going to logistics.

Sales and distribution.

Every 32 you go to financial supply chain management.

Under accounting and go to credit management.

And go to master data.

The transaction for that is UK underscore BP.

It's just a fancy transaction that takes you to the credit management view of the business partner.

So here is the second key change.

Credit management.

View of BP.

Business partner.

Just like the way we have a sales view, finance view, so on and so forth and business partner based

on roles.

There is a new role in business partner that starts with you, M.

Ukm 0001.

This is the name of the role.

This role gives the customer a credit management view.

Think of this as the equivalent of FD 32.

Remember in FD 32 an SD consultant or consultant?

Can go and set the credit limits, set the credit risk groups, so on and so forth.

Right.

Now this is all gone.

And instead.

All of that is pulled up into the business partners view called Ukm 0001 role.

That's basically a credit management view.

So go here.

You game underscore beep or you can just go to beep and then create a role called ukm 000.

What do we have here?

For example, let's go to the general view.

Once the view is enabled.

You can go to the credit profile.

And then see, there is a whole bunch of rules here.

We don't have to worry about that at this point.

Go to the credit segment data, right.

Just like how you go to sales area data for sales use.

Right.

Go to the credit segment data and give a credit limit here.

And how long is it valid until?

Right.

This is very similar to how you do it in 32, isn't it?

In 32, you go set a credit limit based on a certain combination of credit control area and customer.

Same thing here for this business partner.

119.

For this credit segment.

This is important.

0004 credit segment.

This could be basically, say, a particular line of business.

Right now, credit management roll up is one advantage.

Whereas the second advantage is.

Line of business.

He could be the same company doing business with us.

But we want to extend credit limit based on the line of business, for example.

We do apparel sales.

All right.

We do electronic sales.

We do something else.

We want to extend a different limit for apparel, a different limit for electronics.

It's all in the same company code.

Can you do that?

Yes, you can do it with credit segments, as you can see.

For the same business partner.

You can have credit limits set for different credit segments.

Well, let's go.

Maintain credit data for 0001 credit segment.

Go there and set a credit limit of 30,000.

Credit limit increased and save.

Data is saved.

Now.

Do you see it?

Credit limit can be maintained separately by credit segment.

001 is maintained.

004 is maintained.

Now, if these credit segments are allowed to be rolled up to the main segment in the configuration,

remember the check mark, they could very well be rolled up to the main segment.

So every 32 is gone and the 000 role maintains all the credit data.
