# BRF+ Examples

## Introduction
The provided text explains the concept and functionality of BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus) in SAP S/4HANA, particularly focusing on its role as a rules engine. A rules engine is a system that applies a set of predefined rules to determine outcomes based on given conditions.

## Understanding BRF+
### Rules Engine
- **Definition**: A system that applies a set of predefined rules to determine outcomes based on given conditions.
- **Example**: Traffic rules (e.g., if the light is green, you go; if there is a stop sign and no oncoming traffic, you proceed; otherwise, you stop).

### BRF+ as a Rules Engine
- **Design**: BRF+ is designed to be programmed without extensive coding knowledge.
- **Usage**: Intended for functional consultants to configure rules for various business processes, such as pricing or output determination.
- **Complexity**: Often requires specialized consultants, typically with an ABAP background, to handle intricate configurations.

## Example Scenario: Banking
### Determining Loan Interest Rate
1. **Inputs Needed**:
   - Customer credit rating
   - Customer's age
   - Marital status
   - Current Federal Reserve rate
   - Type of home
2. **Process**:
   - Functional consultant provides requirements.
   - BRF+ consultant builds the application to process inputs and generate outputs.
3. **Outputs**:
   - Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
   - Loan terms

## Role of Functional Consultant in Output Determination
### Responsibilities
1. **Specify Requirements**: Provide detailed requirements for the rules.
2. **Development**: Get the rules developed by a BRF+ consultant.
3. **Testing**: Test the outputs by creating documents and ensuring correct output generation.
4. **Maintain Master Data**: Maintain necessary master data using the transaction code `OPD` (Output Parameter Determination).

### Condition Records
- **Definition**: Master data required for the configuration to work.
- **Example**: For output determination, condition records specify details such as payer, medium, validity, etc.
- **Maintenance**: Although not called condition records in BRF+, the concept of maintaining master data remains.

## Advantages of Using BRF+ and OPD
### Consolidation
- **Unified Configuration**: Consolidates the configuration process across different functional areas (e.g., SD, MM, FI) into two transactions: BRF+ and OPD.
- **Simplification**: Reduces the need for multiple transaction codes and configurations in different modules.

## Summary
- **BRF+**: Provides a powerful and flexible framework for managing business rules.
- **OPD**: Used for maintaining the necessary master data to support these rules.
- **Expertise**: Typically requires an ABAP consultant with BRF+ expertise for configuration.

## Conclusion
BRF+ and OPD streamline the output determination process in SAP S/4HANA, making it more efficient and manageable. While this overview provides a brief introduction, a deeper understanding of BRF+ requires more extensive learning.


The provided text explains the concept and functionality of BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus) in SAP S/4HANA, particularly focusing on its role as a rules engine. A rules engine is a system that applies a set of predefined rules to determine outcomes based on given conditions. For example, a traffic rule might state that if the light is green, you go, and if there is a stop sign and no oncoming traffic, you proceed; otherwise, you stop. Similarly, BRF+ operates on a set of if-then-else rules designed to be configured without extensive programming knowledge.

BRF+ is intended to be used by functional consultants who need to configure rules for various business processes, such as pricing or output determination. Traditionally, configuring such rules required the help of an ABAP consultant to write custom code. However, BRF+ is designed to allow functional consultants to create and manage these rules through a visual configuration interface, reducing the need for programming. Despite this, the complexity of BRF+ often means that specialized consultants, typically with an ABAP background, are still required to handle the more intricate configurations.

An example provided in the text illustrates how BRF+ can be used in a banking scenario to determine the interest rate for a home loan. The rules might consider factors such as the customer's credit rating, age, marital status, current Federal Reserve rate, and type of home. Based on these inputs, BRF+ can calculate the annual percentage rate (APR) and other loan terms. The functional consultant provides the requirements, and the BRF+ consultant builds the application to process these inputs and generate the desired outputs.

In the context of output determination, the functional consultant's role involves specifying the requirements, getting the rules developed, testing the outputs, and maintaining the necessary master data. Although the term "condition records" is used, it refers to the master data required for the configuration to work, similar to how condition records are used in the traditional condition technique. This master data is maintained using the transaction code OPD (Output Parameter Determination).

The development of the rules is done in BRF+ by a technical consultant, while the functional consultant tests the outputs by creating documents and ensuring the outputs are generated correctly. The text highlights the advantage of using BRF+ and OPD for output determination, as it consolidates the configuration process across different functional areas (e.g., SD, MM, FI) into these two transactions. This simplifies the process and reduces the need for multiple transaction codes and configurations in different modules. In summary, BRF+ provides a powerful and flexible framework for managing business rules, while OPD is used for maintaining the necessary master data to support these rules.


So b r of plus.

Is designed, like I said, as a rules engine.

Rules engine.

What is a rule?

Traffic rule says if it's green, you go.

If it is a stop sign.

And if there is no oncoming traffic.

Then go.

Else stop.

That's an example of a traffic rule, right?

So basically b r of plus is a set of if then else kind of rules.

Ideally.

The baby of Plus is designed.

It supposed to be programmed?

Without programming.

What do I mean by that?

Whenever you need to configure rules.

For example, I'm a functional consultant.

I need to configure a set of rules.

These rules could be rules that I've used in pricing, condition, technique or elsewhere.

Or even a set of requirement routines.

A requirement routine is also a set of rules.

It has some bunch of code that goes if then else some selects and then finally says yes or no.

If I have to do it, I can do it.

I need the help of an Abap consultant.

But if I have to do it.

B r of plus is designed in such a way that a functional consultant in an ideal world.

Can go.

Program these rules without the use of programming language.

It's a kind of a visual configuration or visual or rather visual coding.

So although it's designed for a function consultant.

And end users.

This can get pretty involved.

So typically, specialist consultants, typically from above, they get trained in B plus.

And we as functional consultants again play the role of give the requirements, get it done.

Let's take an example.

This is the classic example.

Now say you're running SAP for a bank or a financial institution.

And somebody walks in or puts an application and says they want a loan on a home.

Right.

And you want to determine the rate of interest that you can offer.

So what do you need here?

You need to know the customer credit rating.

The customers age, marital status, The current Fed rate.

And the type of home.

So on and so forth.

Right.

And finally, what do you do?

You determine the terms like essentially.

The APR or the rate of interest.

What do you need as input?

Probably you need the SSN age, the status, things that you need from the customer.

We have this input.

You can code VR of plus in such a way that it does all this magic and finally outputs what you need.

The APR and other terms like these are the terms based on which I can offer you this percentage.

The plus consultant can build an application that, given this input, it will provide you the output

based on the logic that you provide him.

Extend the same logic to output.

In the case of an output, what is your role as a functional consultant?

So you give the requirements.

Right.

You get it developed.

You test it?

Then finally maintain condition records.

What do you mean, condition records?

Do we still have to maintain condition records?

It's not condition technique, right?

Well, I'm using the word condition records.

Because Condition records basically is master data that you have to.

Provide for the configuration to work.

You can build a set of rules, but you still need data.

Example You've built all of the rules for output determination, let's say using condition technique.

But finally, you have to give the condition records, right, for this payer, this medium.

This is the validity of the condition record for this soul two, for this bill to blah, blah, blah,

blah, blah.

Those are output records.

Condition records, right?

So you still have to maintain them.

But they're not called output condition records anymore because we're not using condition.

But you still have to maintain that master data so that fundamental does not go away.

So where do you do this part?

This part is done in a transaction called o, p, D, more or less like output determination.

So the development.

Is done in B plus.

Baobab consultant based on your requirements.

And of course, you test it by creating documents like create a billing document.

Test if the output is coming properly.

And in order for the output to come properly, you have to go maintain master data.

You do that using opt.

One of the beauties of this.

Is that irrespective of your.

An consultant.

Consultant.

Consultant.

Fee.

Consultant.

Everything is done in these two transactions.

R of plus.

Traditionally, if I am a consultant, I have to go to output determination inside my output control.

And do the configuration there.

If I were an consultant, I would have to go to SPRO material management under that output.

Under that configuration.

Same thing with Fi.

Now all of that is coming together using this new technique plus.

And all you have to know is these two transactions.

One is B plus, and the second is D.

Two transactions.

And that's all you need to know about output.

Plus is typically for the technical consultant and is for the functional consultant.

That's a huge advantage.

Irrespective of the functional area.

These are the only two transaction codes you need to know from an output perspective.

Right.

In the next chapter, we're going to go configure some condition records using.
