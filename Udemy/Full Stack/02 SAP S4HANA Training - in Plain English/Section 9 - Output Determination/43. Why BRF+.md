# Why BRF+

## Introduction
When I started learning output determination using BRF+, I found it quite confusing at first. I was constantly comparing it to the traditional output determination procedure that I was already familiar with. The traditional method was straightforward, so I wondered why the new method seemed so complicated.

However, after some time, I realized that output determination with BRF+ isn't actually complicated—it's just different from the old condition technique. The new method is more flexible, which can make it seem daunting initially. But with enough practice, using BRF+ for output determination becomes comfortable.

## Why Use BRF+?

### Advantages of BRF+
We've already seen some examples that highlight its advantages. There are many scenarios that are not possible with the standard output determination procedure based on the condition technique.

#### Example Scenarios
1. **Multiple Output Formats**:
   - If you need the same output type (e.g., D000) to be sent as a print to the sold-to party, as an email to the first ship-to party, and in another format to the second ship-to party, this isn't possible with the standard condition technique.
   
2. **Language-Based Forms**:
   - If you want to use different forms based on the language (e.g., form one for English, form two for German, and another form for other languages), this isn't possible with the standard outputs.
   
3. **Car Dealer Scenario**:
   - If you're a car dealer and need to print two copies of a document when the partner function is "dealer" (one copy for you and one for the customer), this is very complicated with the standard output determination.

### Flexibility of BRF+
These examples show that while BRF+ may initially seem more complex, it offers much greater flexibility to meet various customer requirements. In summary, output determination with BRF+ is more flexible and can handle scenarios that are difficult or impossible with the traditional condition technique.

## Conclusion
Output determination with BRF+ has been made a bit more complicated compared to the traditional condition technique, but it provides much more flexibility in catering to the requirements of your customers. With enough practice, using BRF+ for output determination becomes comfortable and advantageous.

So let's recap all we have learned in output determination.

When I started learning output determination using BRF+, I found it quite confusing at first.

So why use BRF+? We've already seen some examples that highlight its advantages. There are many scenarios that are not possible with the standard output determination procedure based on the condition technique.

For example:

If you need the same output type (e.g., D000) to be sent as a print to the sold-to party, as an email to the first ship-to party, and in another format to the second ship-to party, this isn't possible with the standard condition technique.

In summary, output determination with BRF+ is more flexible and can handle scenarios that are difficult or impossible with the traditional condition technique.

This text emphasizes the benefits of BRF+ despite its initial complexity, highlighting its flexibility and ability to handle more complex scenarios compared to the traditional condition technique.


When I started learning output determination using BRL Plus.

By the time I got to this point, I was in la la land already.

The reason is I was always trying to compare against the traditional output determination procedure

that we already know of.

That was easy, right?

So why complicate the hell out of this?

That was the question that I always had.

Why?

And it took some time for me to understand why.

Why output determination is so complicated now.

It's not really complicated.

It's just not based on the old condition technique.

Just by making it more flexible, it looks a bit daunting, but if you practice enough output determination

using plus will get pretty comfy.

That's the worst part.

But in terms of why, why use this?

Plus, that's because we have seen some examples already.

There are many things that are not possible using the standard output determination procedure based

on condition technique.

A simple example is.

I have a scenario where the same output type D zero 0 or 0 zero needs to go as a print.

The soul to.

And for the first ship to the same output type.

Need to go as an email and for the second ship to the same output type.

Needs to go.

So on and so forth.

Is it possible using the standard condition technique based outputs?

No.

Right.

Let's take another example.

If the language is English, use form one.

The language is German.

Use form two.

If the language is something else, use the next form.

Is this possible in the standard outputs?

No.

Right.

I'm just trying to give you examples of scenarios.

Simple examples.

There are so very difficult in the standard output determination.

Let's say if, for example.

You're a car dealer and there is a soul to there is a ship to and then there is a partner function called

dealer.

So if the partner function is dealer DL, then print two copies.

Write one copy for us, and one copy may be for the customer.

All I'm trying to do is give you very, very simple examples of scenarios that are so very complicated

in the standard output determination based on condition technique.

So essentially output determination.

Has been made a bit more complicated using Braf plus.

But it makes it so much more flexible in catering to the requirements of your customer.

So let's recap all we have learned in output determination.
