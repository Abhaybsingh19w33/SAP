# What is BRF+?

## Introduction
In the SAP S/4HANA environment, output determination has shifted from the traditional condition technique to a new method called BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus). While the condition technique is still used in other areas such as pricing, it is no longer employed for output determination. Instead, BRF+ is now the standard for handling outputs like invoices, sales orders, deliveries, and purchase documents.

## BRF+ Overview
BRF+ is not a new technology introduced with S/4HANA; it has existed in SAP ECC as well. Users can access it via the transaction code `BRF+`, which opens the framework in a new browser window. SAP decided to leverage this existing framework for output determination in S/4HANA, replacing the standard condition technique previously used.

## Condition Technique vs. BRF+
### Condition Technique
- **Definition**: A set of rules configured by consultants to manage various business processes.
- **Usage**: Used in areas like pricing, where rules dictate discounts, rebates, and pricing conditions.
- **Limitations**: Often requires custom coding by ABAP consultants for complex requirements and alternate calculation routines.

### BRF+
- **Definition**: A flexible rules engine or rules management system that allows users to configure rules without extensive coding knowledge.
- **Advantages**: Offers greater flexibility and fewer limitations compared to the condition technique.
- **Complexity**: May still require the assistance of technical consultants, often those with an ABAP background who specialize in BRF+.

## Purpose of BRF+
The primary goal of BRF+ is to provide a more adaptable and powerful rules-based system for various business needs, not just output determination. Although pricing is not yet managed by BRF+, it is anticipated that SAP may extend BRF+ to cover pricing in the future as S/4HANA continues to evolve.

## How BRF+ Works
### Transition from Condition Technique
- **Document Types**: In the S/4HANA world, output determination is no longer based on condition technique for document types like invoices, sales orders, deliveries, and purchase documents.
- **Replacement**: Condition technique is replaced by BRF+ for output determination.

### Accessing BRF+
- **Transaction Code**: `BRF+`
- **Interface**: Opens in a new browser window.

### Business Rules Framework Plus
- **History**: BRF+ is the new version of the original Business Rules Framework.
- **Existence**: It has existed in SAP ECC for quite some time.

## Why BRF+?
### Limitations of Condition Technique
- **Flexibility**: Condition technique has limitations and can only go so far.
- **Custom Coding**: Often requires ABAP consultants to write custom code for complex requirements.

### Advantages of BRF+
- **Flexibility**: BRF+ provides far greater flexibility and can be used in situations outside of pricing or output determination.
- **Rules Engine**: Designed to be a flexible rules engine or rules management system where users without coding knowledge can configure rules.

## Summary
- **BRF+**: Stands for Business Rules Framework Plus and is a set of configurable rules used to manage various business processes.
- **Replacement**: Replaces the condition technique for output determination in S/4HANA.
- **Flexibility and Capabilities**: Offers greater flexibility and capabilities compared to the condition technique.
- **Future Potential**: May extend to cover pricing in the future as S/4HANA evolves.

## Conclusion
BRF+ aims to provide a more powerful and adaptable rules engine for SAP users. In the next chapter, we will see BRF+ in action.


In the SAP S/4HANA environment, output determination has shifted from the traditional condition technique to a new method called BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus). While the condition technique is still used in other areas such as pricing, it is no longer employed for output determination. Instead, BRF+ is now the standard for handling outputs like invoices, sales orders, deliveries, and purchase documents.

BRF+ is not a new technology introduced with S/4HANA; it has existed in SAP ECC as well. Users can access it via the transaction code BRF+, which opens the framework in a new browser window. SAP decided to leverage this existing framework for output determination in S/4HANA, replacing the standard condition technique previously used.

The condition technique is essentially a set of rules configured by consultants to manage various business processes. For example, in pricing, rules might dictate that a discount applies when the net volume exceeds a certain amount, or that a rebate is given when the gross volume reaches a specific threshold over a set period. These rules are configured by consultants and used by users through condition records.

BRF+ operates on a similar principle, as it is also a set of business rules. However, BRF+ offers greater flexibility and fewer limitations compared to the condition technique. While the condition technique is effective, it can only go so far and often requires custom coding by ABAP consultants for more complex requirements and alternate calculation routines. BRF+, on the other hand, is designed to be a flexible rules engine or rules management system that allows users to configure rules without needing extensive coding knowledge.

Despite its flexibility, BRF+ can still be complex and may require the assistance of technical consultants, often those with an ABAP background who specialize in BRF+. The primary goal of BRF+ is to provide a more adaptable and powerful rules-based system for various business needs, not just output determination. Although pricing is not yet managed by BRF+, it is anticipated that SAP may extend BRF+ to cover pricing in the future as S/4HANA continues to evolve.

In summary, BRF+ stands for Business Rules Framework Plus and is a set of configurable rules used to manage various business processes. It replaces the condition technique for output determination in S/4HANA and offers greater flexibility and capabilities. While it can be complex, BRF+ aims to provide a more powerful and adaptable rules engine for SAP users.

In the S4 world.

Output determination is no longer based on condition technique.

So the document type, F2, G2, whatever I'm talking about invoice in general, but it could be invoice

sales order delivery purchase document, any output technique.

Is typically associated to a document type, Right?

So in the S4 world.

This assignment.

Is gone.

So what replaces condition technique?

This is replaced by.

Something called B r f plus.

Business rules framework.

Now, please remember, condition technique is not replaced.

Meaning condition technique as such is still used in pricing is still used in many other areas, but

condition technique is no longer used only for output determination.

Instead.

In s four Hana for output determination.

A new technique called B plus is used.

Well, some of you might already be aware of, Plus.

We are, of course, is not new in S4 Hana.

Meaning.

It's not a technology that was newly created and introduced in S four Hana.

Even if you go to your EC.

Type in the transaction.

B r f plus.

This is the transaction code.

You'll see the framework coming into a new browser.

So this already existed?

ASAP.

Choose to use this framework instead of output determination.

Standard output determination using condition technique.

To do outputs.

That is the change.

So what we are going to learn.

Is how to do output determination using this new technique called B plus.

So what is this?

Plus.

B r f plus business rules framework.

Plus is the new version.

Originally, there was a business rules framework.

And then plus was the next version.

And this happened pretty long time ago.

This is not new.

This is not like the last six months or last one year.

This has existed in SEC for quite some time.

So why did it exist?

What is the purpose of RF Plus?

To understand that.

Let's go to condition technique itself.

Well, there are different ways to understand.

Different modules use differently.

But nevertheless, the problem that solves is essentially the same as the problem we are trying to solve

using condition technique.

So what is condition Technique?

Condition technique is essentially a set of rules configured by the consultant.

Right.

So this is condition technique.

That we know traditionally existed in for a very long time and has been used in many, many areas.

So this is a set of rules.

That's all it is, isn't it?

Can you deny it?

Condition technique is just a set of rules.

What kind of rules?

If you take pricing.

This discount should apply when the net volume exceeds 10,000 kilos.

That's a rule.

A rebate should apply.

When the gross volume exceeds, say, $100,000 across six months.

Two months.

Whatever be the time frame.

That's how we set rules in pricing using condition technique, right?

This price should apply.

Dollar ten for this Parker pen.

If the timeframe is between so and so after April 1st, the price is going to change.

That's a set of rules.

This set of rules.

Or configured by the consultant and used by the user by creating condition records.

So what is B plus then?

Biography plus is also a set of rules.

It's there right in the name.

Business rules.

Business rules.

It is a set of rules.

Now, the next question you have is when you have condition technique that is so beautifully set up

to configure rules, business rules.

Why do you need a new technology called VR Plus?

Well conditioned technique has limitations.

VR plus doesn't have any limitations.

In fact, BR Plus has been used in situations outside of pricing or output.

Where the flexibility that it provides.

Is far, far ahead of condition technique.

Condition Technique is good.

But it only takes you to a certain extent.

If you want to know some examples.

Requirements.

Alternate calculation routines.

These are things that you plug in, but your Abap consultant has to write for you.

Right.

That's where condition technique falls apart.

I mean, falls apart from the hands of a functional consultant.

Essentially the original idea in VR of Plus is to have a flexible rules engine.

It's called a rules engine or a rules management system where somebody without a knowledge of coding

can configure a rules based system.

That's the original idea.

But nevertheless in the current situation.

Out of plus is still complicated and cannot be done without the help of some technical consultant.

It need not be.

Typically it is someone who comes from an Abap background but specializes in B plus.

So that is B plus.

So let me quickly summarize what is B plus.

So b, r of plus stands for Business Rules Framework.

And as the name says, it's a set of rules to configure anything.

In fact, it need not only be used for output, determination, pricing.

Pricing is still not there with BR Plus, but I'm guessing it could be in the next couple of years because

SAP s four Hana is evolving pretty fast.

But it need not be just used for output.

It could be used for many things where you need a set of rules that are configurable.

Well in the next chapter we'll see of plus in action.
