# BRF+ .. First Look

## Introduction
The provided text explains the initial steps for using BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus) in SAP S/4HANA for output determination. It begins by mentioning the transaction code `BRF+`, which opens the BRF+ framework in a browser. This framework is used to manage output determination for various business processes, such as billing documents, orders, and purchase orders. SAP provides a base configuration for these processes, which can be accessed and imported into BRF+.

## Steps to Start with BRF+

### Accessing BRF+
1. **Transaction Code**: `BRF+`
   - Opens the BRF+ framework in a browser.

### SAP Note and XML Files
1. **SAP Note**: 2248229
   - Contains a set of XML files for different business processes.
   - Examples of XML files:
     - Delivery: `OPD v2 output delivery`
     - Billing: `OPD v2 output billing`
     - Purchase Contracts, Purchase Orders, RFQs, etc.

### Importing XML Files into BRF+
1. **Set User Mode to Expert**:
   - Ensure the user mode is set to "expert" to enable XML file import.
2. **Navigate to Tools**:
   - Select `XML import`.
3. **Select XML File**:
   - Choose the XML file you want to import (e.g., billing document, delivery, purchase order).
4. **Customize Request**:
   - Select a customizing request.
5. **Test Run**:
   - Perform a test run to check if the import is successful.
6. **Import XML**:
   - Upload the XML file and check for consistency.

### Viewing Imported Configuration
1. **Search for Imported Object**:
   - Use the workbench to open the imported object.
2. **Example**:
   - For billing: `OPD billing`
   - View the configuration, which includes data objects, expressions, functions, rules, and rule sets.

## Understanding BRF+
### Configuration Representation
- The XML file represents the configuration for output determination.
- Includes:
  - Data objects
  - Expressions
  - Functions
  - Rules
  - Rule sets

### Complexity of BRF+
- Learning BRF+ is a complex task that typically requires specialized knowledge.
- In most projects, an ABAP consultant with expertise in BRF+ handles the configuration of rules for output determination.

## Summary
- **BRF+**: Business Rules Framework Plus is used for output determination in SAP S/4HANA.
- **XML Import**: Import XML files provided by SAP to configure output determination.
- **Configuration**: View and manage configurations including data objects, expressions, functions, rules, and rule sets.
- **Expertise**: Typically requires an ABAP consultant with BRF+ expertise for configuration.

## Conclusion
BRF+ provides a powerful and adaptable framework for managing output determination in SAP S/4HANA. While this overview provides a brief introduction, a deeper understanding of BRF+ requires more extensive learning.


The provided text explains the initial steps for using BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus) in SAP S/4HANA for output determination. It begins by mentioning the transaction code BRF+, which opens the BRF+ framework in a browser. This framework is used to manage output determination for various business processes, such as billing documents, orders, and purchase orders. SAP provides a base configuration for these processes, which can be accessed and imported into BRF+.

To start, users need to navigate to a specific SAP Note (2248229) that contains a set of XML files. These XML files correspond to different business processes, such as delivery, billing, purchase contracts, and purchase orders. The text provides an example of how the XML file for a billing document might look and explains that these files can be imported into BRF+ to configure output determination.

The process of importing an XML file into BRF+ involves several steps. First, users need to ensure that the user mode is set to "expert" to enable XML file import. Then, they navigate to the tools menu, select "XML import," and choose the XML file they want to import. Users can perform a test run to check if the import is successful. If the import is successful, the XML file will be imported, and users can view the configuration associated with the imported file.

The text also mentions that the XML file represents the configuration for output determination, including data objects, expressions, functions, rules, and rule sets. It emphasizes that learning BRF+ is a complex task that typically requires specialized knowledge. In most projects, an ABAP consultant with expertise in BRF+ handles the configuration of rules for output determination. The text concludes by stating that while the explanation provides a brief overview of BRF+, a deeper understanding of the framework requires more extensive learning.

The transaction code to open plus's be rf plus.

Easy, right?

Once you click that.

It opens brave Plus in a browser.

Now, you don't have to create output determination for, say, billing document from scratch.

SAP has provided the base configuration.

For output, determination for orders, for purchase orders for all the supported business processes

by version using a set of nodes.

So the first thing that you had to do was.

Transaction code.

B r f plus, and it opened a browser where it showed some screen.

Now, here is what I want you to do.

Go to Node.

2248229.

I have that handy on a piece of paper so you don't have to memorize it.

Just make a note of it.

And I can't give you access to that node because it's owned by SAP.

So what you have over there is a set of XML files.

So this is how the files would look like.

For example, for delivery.

It's going to look like this OPD v2 output delivery for billing.

It's going to look like this.

And these are for 15.

11.

And the files for 1610 are going to be something similar.

You know, these are the output files for purchase, contract purchase order, RFQ, so on and so forth.

Well, let me open the billing document output configuration.

What do you see there?

You see.

An XML file.

This is an XML file.

You can import this XML.

Into B plus.

And it will show you what's there in that XML in the form of a nice config.

How do you do that?

The way to do that is to first go here.

And make sure that the user mode is expert.

If you don't do it, you can't import XML files.

So it's already set to expert.

Now go to tools.

Then select XML import.

Select the XML file you want to import.

In this case, billing document or delivery purchase order whatever you want.

Select a customising request.

Right.

Like so.

Then you can do a test run first like this.

Upload XML.

And then it'll run some magic and say, finally, if it has succeeded or not.

So object is consistent.

If you don't see that there is some problem.

So if everything goes well.

The XML file will be imported.

And finally, you can view that the configuration behind that XML file.

Well, I have already imported one, and I'm going to show that to you.

So let me search for the one that I have.

Imported workbench, open object.

And then the one that I've imported is related to.

Billing.

Right.

So go to.

Hope.

D billing, blah, blah, blah.

Yeah, this is the one.

So this is the one that I've imported.

So the XML file is basically a representation of the config associated with this object.

The object for output determination for billing.

So it has a bunch of things.

Like data objects, expressions, functions, rules.

Rule sets.

Now, we are not going to learn plus.

Biography plus is a subject in itself.

It takes at least ten hours to learn.

Plus.

So we are not going to learn B of plus.

And you don't have to as a functional consultant.

Typically in my project there was an Abap consultant who got specialized in plus, and he helped us

configure all the rules behind our output determination using Plus.

Now, that's a brief preview on B plus.

Let's get a little more into B plus and see what it can do for us.
