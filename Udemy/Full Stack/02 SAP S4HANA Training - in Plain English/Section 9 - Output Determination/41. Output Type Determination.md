# Output Type Determination

## Introduction
The provided text outlines a step-by-step demonstration of configuring and testing output determination in SAP S/4HANA using the BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus) and OPD (Output Parameter Determination) transactions.

## Steps for Output Type Determination

### Step 1: Select Document Category
1. **Document Types**: Sales document, delivery, billing document, etc.
2. **Error Handling**: If rules are not configured in BRF+ for the selected document category, an error message will appear indicating that no determinations were found.
   - **Solution**: Upload the necessary rules using the BRF+ transaction in expert mode.

### Step 2: Select Document Type and Output Type
1. **Output Type Options**: For example, billing document, receiver channel, printer settings, etc.
2. **Descriptive Output Types**: In BRF+, output types are more descriptive (e.g., "billing_document" or "purchase_document") compared to traditional four-letter codes like BA00 or BA01.
3. **Parameters**: Similar to the field catalog in the traditional condition technique, parameters can be configured by the consultant.

### Example: Creating a New Billing Document Type
1. **Create New Billing Document Type**: XF09
2. **Associate Output Type**:
   - Edit the document type.
   - Add a new entry.
   - Specify the output type and other parameters such as dispatch time.
3. **Save and Activate Configuration**:
   - Ensure all mandatory fields (e.g., dispatch time) are filled.
   - Save and activate the configuration.

### Step 3: Test the Setup
1. **Create Order**:
   - Create a customer in BP.
   - Provide test purchase order and payment terms.
   - Create material and check for any missing information.
2. **Create Delivery**:
   - Deliver the order.
   - Post goods issue.
3. **Create Billing Document**:
   - Generate an invoice.
   - Check the output section to ensure the output type "billing_document" is correctly determined.

## Importance of Maintaining Master Data
- Ensure that all necessary parameters are configured to correctly determine and issue outputs.

## Conclusion
The next chapter will cover how to determine the receiver and channel for the outputs, further detailing the comprehensive process of output determination in SAP S/4HANA using BRF+ and OPD.



The provided text outlines a step-by-step demonstration of configuring and testing output determination in SAP S/4HANA using the BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus) and OPD (Output Parameter Determination) transactions. The process begins by selecting the type of document for which you want to issue the output, such as a sales document, delivery, or billing document. If the rules for the selected document category have not been configured in BRF+, an error message will appear, indicating that no determinations were found. This means that the necessary rules need to be uploaded using the BRF+ transaction in expert mode.

Once the rules are configured, you can proceed to select the document type and start with the output type determination. For example, if you select a billing document, you will see options for output type, receiver channel, printer settings, and other parameters. In the new BRF+ based output determination, output types are more descriptive, such as "billing_document" or "purchase_document," compared to the traditional four-letter codes like BA00 or BA01. The parameters used to determine the output type are similar to the field catalog in the traditional condition technique, and they can be configured by the consultant.

The text provides an example of creating a new billing document type called "XF09" and associating an output type with it. This involves editing the document type, adding a new entry, and specifying the output type and other parameters such as dispatch time. Once the configuration is saved and activated, the next step is to test the setup by creating an order, delivery, and billing document. The text walks through the process of creating an order, delivering it, and generating an invoice, ensuring that the output type "billing_document" is correctly determined and displayed in the output section of the billing document.

The demonstration highlights the importance of maintaining master data and configuring the necessary parameters to ensure that outputs are correctly determined and issued. The text concludes by indicating that the next chapter will cover how to determine the receiver and channel for the outputs, further detailing the comprehensive process of output determination in SAP S/4HANA using BRF+ and OPD.



All right, Now it's time for a quick demo.

So step one, select the kind of document that you want to issue the output for.

So go to select the document category.

Like it sales document?

Is it delivery?

Is it billing?

So on and so forth.

Now, if you have not configured the rules for that particular billing document category, then it will

show an error.

For example, if you select billing document, you should see a set of determinations here in the second

dropdown, like output type receiver channel, so on and so forth.

For example, if you select an option here, say sales document, you see a message here that says no

determinations were found.

What does that mean?

This dropdown is empty as well.

This means that rules have not been configured in plus transaction for that particular document category.

So all you have to do is go to that particular node that we mentioned at the very beginning of the course,

download the XML and upload it using plus in expert mode.

Save it and you should see that configuration here.

Now if you are working on a commercial s four Hana system, you typically would have had all of this

set up already.

So you don't have to really go download them and do all that stuff.

But essentially what that does is give you or give the developer a starting point based on which he

can build the scenarios that you are going to give.

As requirements.

And it is not mandatory.

You know, you don't need that XML.

The consultant can build all of them from scratch.

It's just that it's easy if you have a template.

So step number two.

Is select your document type and then start with the output type.

The first thing that you do is select the output type.

Right.

All right.

So what do we have here?

We have a billing type.

We have a sales org and then we have customer group.

And based on these three parameters, an output type is being determined like billing document is the

output type.

Now in the new plus based output determination.

The output type is not four letters like zero zero or B00.

The output type is very descriptive.

It says billing, underscore, document or purchase, underscore, document, so on and so forth.

The combination based on which the output type is determined is not limited to just billing type sales,

organ, customer group.

These parameters are very similar to your field catalog.

You have a list of parameters and the list can be configured by your consultant.

You want to change the way these outputs are triggered.

You can go to table settings.

And add more parameters.

We'll see that later.

So what I have done is create a new billing document type called Xf zero nine.

So I've got a Z, Z, Z or nine, and then standard delivery, and then a custom billing document type

called Xf zero nine.

And.

Associated an output type with it.

How did I do that?

You go to edit?

And select your document type like make a new entry.

This is something that I've already created, so let me delete that and create it from scratch.

So add.

Direct value input and.

The one that we need is Xf zero nine.

That's the one that I have created.

There we go.

That's our invoice.

And click okay.

And you can also specify a sales org.

But for now let me not specify a sales org.

And in output type direct value input.

And.

Select billing underscore document.

See.

So the entry is there.

Save it.

Object saved successfully.

And activate now it says.

So my activation has failed.

So it says mandatory input.

Dispatch time is missing.

So dispatch time has been set as mandatory.

So let's go.

Set the dispatch time.

The dispatch time.

Is either 1 or 2 immediate or scheduled.

So let's set it to immediate.

Okay.

Go up, save it, and let's try to activate it again.

Do you really want to activate?

Yes.

Okay.

Object.

Saved and activated.

So we have created output determination data in OPD and we want to test whether our order delivery billing

is working or not.

So real quick, I'm going to create an order.

I'm going to create a delivery and I'm going to create a billing document.

And that should be pretty easy for us.

Via 0109.

I have done some configuration behind the scenes so that it's it's really easy for you so I don't bother

you with all the details.

I've created a customer in BP.

Let's give it a test purchase order and a payment Terms Incoterms.

That should be it.

It's not the Inco version.

Okay.

And I've created a material.

Material Master is the same one.

I'll put a praise already.

And let me check if something is missing.

Incompletion log.

Everything seems okay.

Let's go deliver this.

Order.

For this plant created a storage location.

And let me pick a quantity of one.

And do a postcodes issue.

All right.

Postcodes issue is done.

Now let me create an invoice.

The invoice is ready.

Now go to output.

Go to header output.

And you see that the output type billing document.

Is created, right?

If you go inside, you'll see the form template that was being determined.

The language.

The form language.

The channel.

What's the current status?

What's the sender?

Who's the receiver?

So on and so forth.

So this is how outputs are determined.

Once the output type is determined.

The next point is who is the receiver?

Is it the payer?

Is it the bill?

Two is the ship two.

So the first step.

Was going to select the document category, blah, blah, blah, and then do output type determination.

Right.

And once you select output type, you create.

Condition records.

And now you can go and create a billing document and you should see that output type being determined.

And the next chapter, we'll see how the receiver and channel are determined.
