# Summary

## Introduction
Traditionally, in SAP ECC, output determination is performed using the condition technique. This involves assigning an output determination procedure to the document type. However, in SAP S/4HANA, this method has been replaced by a new procedure using BRF+ (Business Rules Framework Plus). The transaction code to access it is `BRF+`.

## BRF+ Overview
Essentially, BRF+ is a set of rules, similar to the condition technique, which is based on field catalogs, condition tables, access sequences, and so on. BRF+ achieves the same goal through programming.

### Standard Configurations
SAP provides standard configurations for various document types such as:
- Billing documents
- Purchase documents
- Sales orders
- Delivery documents

These configurations can be downloaded from SAP and uploaded into your SAP S/4HANA system. Once uploaded, they can be customized to meet specific business requirements.

### Rules Engine
BRF+ acts as a rules engine, which can be compared to traffic rules: if the light is green, you go; if it is red, you stop. It is a set of rules that can ideally be programmed by a functional consultant using if-then-else logic. However, due to its complexity, the assistance of an ABAP consultant trained in BRF+ is often required.

## Functional Consultant's Role
As a functional consultant, your role involves:
1. Providing requirements
2. Getting the rules developed by a consultant or developing them yourself
3. Testing the setup
4. Maintaining data using condition records (referred to as output data in this context)

The transaction code for maintaining this data is `OPD` (Output Parameter Determination).

## Comparison: Condition Technique vs. BRF+
### Condition Technique
- **Elements**: Field catalog, condition tables
- **Output Determination**: Fixed receiver, channel, dispatch time, program

### BRF+
- **Elements**: Elements, decision tables
- **Output Determination**: Allows further rules to determine multiple receivers, channels, dispatch times, and programs for each output type

## Quick Demo
1. **Document Category**: Select billing
2. **Output Type**: Select billing_document (standard SAP-provided output type)
3. **Condition Records**: Create condition records or output data for the output type
4. **Receivers and Channels**: Determine multiple roles, channels, and receivers for each output

## Flexibility of BRF+
BRF+ simplifies the configuration of scenarios that are complex or impossible with the traditional condition technique. This flexibility makes BRF+ a powerful tool for managing output determination in SAP S/4HANA.

### Example Scenarios
1. **Multiple Output Formats**: Send the same output type as a print to the sold-to party, as an email to the first ship-to party, and in another format to the second ship-to party.
2. **Language-Based Forms**: Use different forms based on the language (e.g., form one for English, form two for German, and another form for other languages).
3. **Car Dealer Scenario**: Print two copies of a document when the partner function is "dealer" (one copy for you and one for the customer).

## Conclusion
Output determination with BRF+ has been made a bit more complicated compared to the traditional condition technique, but it provides much more flexibility in catering to the requirements of your customers. With enough practice, using BRF+ for output determination becomes comfortable and advantageous.

So let's recap all we have learned about output determination using the new technique in SAP S/4HANA.


Traditionally, in SAP ECC, output determination is performed using the condition technique. This involves assigning an output determination procedure to the document type. However, in SAP S/4HANA, this method has been replaced by a new procedure using BRF+. BRF+ stands for Business Rules Framework Plus, and the transaction code to access it is BRF+. Essentially, BRF+ is a set of rules, similar to the condition technique, which is based on field catalogs, condition tables, access sequences, and so on. BRF+ achieves the same goal through programming.

SAP provides standard configurations for various document types such as billing, purchase documents, sales orders, and delivery documents. These configurations can be downloaded from SAP and uploaded into your SAP S/4HANA system. Once uploaded, they can be customized to meet specific business requirements. BRF+ acts as a rules engine, which can be compared to traffic rules: if the light is green, you go; if it is red, you stop. It is a set of rules that can ideally be programmed by a functional consultant using if-then-else logic. However, due to its complexity, the assistance of an ABAP consultant trained in BRF+ is often required.

BRF+ is designed to allow the configuration of rules without writing code, but practical implementation usually involves a BRF+ consultant. An example provided in the text illustrates the power of BRF+ through a financial application that processes inputs and generates outputs based on ever-changing rules. This demonstrates the capability of BRF+ to configure complex rules without writing a single line of code.

As a functional consultant, your role involves providing requirements, getting the rules developed by a consultant or developing them yourself, testing the setup, and maintaining data using condition records. Although the term "condition records" is used for familiarity, it refers to maintaining output data in this context. The transaction code for maintaining this data is OPD (Output Parameter Determination).

The text also compares the condition technique with BRF+. In the condition technique, elements like the field catalog and condition tables are used, whereas BRF+ uses elements and decision tables. The end result in both methods is the determination of an output type or a set of output types. However, BRF+ offers additional flexibility by allowing further rules to determine multiple receivers, channels, dispatch times, and programs for each output type.

A quick demo is mentioned, where the document category (billing in this case) and output type are selected, and condition records or output data are created for the output type. The standard SAP-provided output type for billing documents is billing_document. Similar standard output types exist for purchase orders, sales orders, and delivery documents. The demo also shows how receivers and channels can be determined, and how multiple roles, channels, and receivers can be configured for each output.

Finally, the text highlights the flexibility of BRF+ based output determination by providing examples of how it simplifies the configuration of scenarios that are complex or impossible with the traditional condition technique. This flexibility makes BRF+ a powerful tool for managing output determination in SAP S/4HANA.


So let's recap all we have learned about output determination using the new technique in SAP s four

Hana.

Traditionally in SEC.

Output determination is done using condition technique.

That condition technique.

The output determination procedure itself is assigned to the document type.

In S4 Hana.

This has been done away with and a new procedure is brought into place using a technique called as Braf

Plus.

Braf Plus stands for Business Rules Framework.

The transaction for that is Braf plus.

Essentially what it is, is a set of rules.

Quite similar to how we think of condition technique as a set of rules based on field catalog condition,

table access sequence, so on and so forth.

B Plus does the same thing based on programming.

So the code is B plus.

And.

ASAP provides standard configuration for billing purchase, purchase document sales order delivery document

using a set of files that you can download from SAP.

Once you download them, you can upload them into your system.

The SAPs for Hana and start to tweak them to suit your business requirements.

Like we said, we are plus.

Is a rules engine.

What's a rules engine?

We try to compare it with traffic rules.

If there is a green go, if there is a red, don't go right.

So it's a set of rules that can be programmed ideally by a functional consultant using if then else

programming.

But still it's difficult.

So you take the help of an Abap consultant who is trained in plus.

So ideally B plus is a tool that can configure rules without programming, but you still need the help

of a B plus consultant.

And then we have taken an example.

An example to show you the power of B plus.

The financial application that based on the ever changing rules, takes some inputs and gives you an

output.

It's not a program, but a set of rules that can be configured in plus.

That shows you the power of Plus.

Without having to write a single line of code.

All of this can be configured using a set of rules.

So now what is your role as a functional consultant?

Your role is to, of course, give the requirements.

Get it developed by the consultant or develop it yourself.

Test it and of course maintain data using.

Condition records.

I'm using the word condition records, although we are not using condition technique because it's easy

for us to relate because we come from that background, but it's maintaining output data.

The transaction for that is p d.

This is where we'll be spending most of our time.

And we tried to do a quick comparison between condition technique and plus, like we have field catalog

here.

And then we have something called elements here.

And then we have in condition technique, we have condition tables, blah, blah, blah.

We have decision tables here.

And finally, the net result is still the same.

An output type or a set of output types are determined.

And the same thing happens here as well.

And another key difference here is once the output type is determined, the receiver, the channel,

the dispatch time, the program, all of them are fixed.

But with B plus, you still have further options to use rules to determine for each output type, you

can determine multiple receivers, multiple channels, multiple dispatch times, multiple programs,

any of that stuff.

That makes us that much more flexible.

Then we try to do a quick demo.

So in.

We selected the document category.

We selected billing in this case and we selected the output type.

And we created condition records or condition data or output data for output type.

The output type was billing underscore document.

That's the standard SAP provided billing document output type for purchase order, there is one for

sales order, there is one for delivery document type.

There are a couple.

And then we went on to see how the receivers can be determined.

Channels can be determined.

And how a combination of for each output, you can have multiple roles, multiple channels, multiple

receivers, so on and so forth.

And finally, we have seen how a printer can be controlled and how the form routine can be controlled.

And we have also seen.

Some scenarios on what makes.

Biography plus based output determination.

Flexible.

So we have seen three examples, very, very simple examples of how.

Be out of place.

Based output determination makes such simple cases so easy to configure compared to the traditional

conditioned, technique based output determination.
