# Deployment Options in S/4HANA

## Introduction
The provided text discusses the deployment options available for implementing SAP S/4HANA. There are three primary deployment options: On-Premise, Cloud, and Hybrid.

## Types of Deployment Options

### 1. On-Premise Deployment
The On-Premise deployment option is the most traditional and widely used method. In this setup, the SAP S/4HANA system is hosted on the company's own hardware, either in their own data center or in a hosted data center. The key characteristic of this option is that the company retains ownership and control over the hardware and software. This deployment is suitable for companies that require extensive customization and prefer to manage their own infrastructure.

### 2. Cloud Deployment
The Cloud deployment option is entirely hosted by a third-party provider, such as SAP or another cloud service provider. In this model, there is no need for the company to install or maintain any hardware or software, as everything is pre-installed and managed by the provider. The cloud environment operates on a pay-as-you-go model, where companies pay based on their usage. This option is ideal for companies with minimal customization needs and those looking for a more flexible and scalable solution.

### 3. Hybrid Deployment
The Hybrid deployment option combines elements of both On-Premise and Cloud deployments. In this setup, certain components of the SAP S/4HANA system are hosted on-premise, while others are hosted in the cloud. For example, a company might choose to host their core ERP system on-premise while utilizing cloud-based CRM solutions. This approach allows companies to leverage the benefits of both deployment models, providing flexibility and scalability while maintaining control over critical systems.

## Suitability of Deployment Options

### On-Premise Deployment
- **Suitable for**: Large enterprises, such as Fortune 500 companies, due to their extensive customization needs and the ability to manage their own infrastructure.

### Cloud Deployment
- **Suitable for**: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with fewer customization requirements.

### Hybrid Deployment
- **Suitable for**: Any company, depending on their specific needs and preferences.

## Responsibilities During Upgrades

### On-Premise Deployment
- **Responsibility**: The company is responsible for managing the upgrade process, including obtaining licenses, installing updates, and performing necessary testing.
- **Upgrade Frequency**: Typically, major releases are done annually.

### Cloud Deployment
- **Responsibility**: Upgrades are handled automatically by the service provider, typically on a quarterly basis.
- **Upgrade Frequency**: Quarterly.

### Hybrid Deployment
- **Responsibility**: A mix of both approaches, with cloud components being upgraded automatically and on-premise components requiring manual intervention.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### On-Premise Deployment
- **Analogy**: Owning a home.
- **Advantages**: Complete control over customization.
- **Disadvantages**: Responsible for maintenance and upgrades.

### Cloud Deployment
- **Analogy**: Renting an apartment.
- **Advantages**: Managed services, no need for hardware or software installation.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited customization options.

### Hybrid Deployment
- **Analogy**: A balance between owning a home and renting an apartment.
- **Advantages**: Flexibility and control based on the company's specific needs.

## Summary
- **On-Premise**: Traditional environment, suitable for large enterprises with extensive customization needs.
- **Cloud**: Hosted environment, suitable for SMEs with minimal customization needs.
- **Hybrid**: Mix of both, suitable for any company depending on specific needs.





The provided text discusses the deployment options available for implementing SAP S/4HANA. There are three primary deployment options: On-Premise, Cloud, and Hybrid.

The On-Premise deployment option is the most traditional and widely used method. In this setup, the SAP S/4HANA system is hosted on the company's own hardware, either in their own data center or in a hosted data center. The key characteristic of this option is that the company retains ownership and control over the hardware and software. This deployment is suitable for companies that require extensive customization and prefer to manage their own infrastructure.

The Cloud deployment option, on the other hand, is entirely hosted by a third-party provider, such as SAP or another cloud service provider. In this model, there is no need for the company to install or maintain any hardware or software, as everything is pre-installed and managed by the provider. The cloud environment operates on a pay-as-you-go model, where companies pay based on their usage. This option is ideal for companies with minimal customization needs and those looking for a more flexible and scalable solution.

The Hybrid deployment option combines elements of both On-Premise and Cloud deployments. In this setup, certain components of the SAP S/4HANA system are hosted on-premise, while others are hosted in the cloud. For example, a company might choose to host their core ERP system on-premise while utilizing cloud-based CRM solutions. This approach allows companies to leverage the benefits of both deployment models, providing flexibility and scalability while maintaining control over critical systems.

The text also explains the suitability of each deployment option for different types of companies. On-Premise deployments are typically favored by large enterprises, such as Fortune 500 companies, due to their extensive customization needs and the ability to manage their own infrastructure. Cloud deployments are more suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with fewer customization requirements. Hybrid deployments can be used by any company, depending on their specific needs and preferences.

During an upgrade, the responsibilities differ based on the deployment model. In an On-Premise deployment, the company is responsible for managing the upgrade process, including obtaining licenses, installing updates, and performing necessary testing. In a Cloud deployment, upgrades are handled automatically by the service provider, typically on a quarterly basis. Hybrid deployments involve a mix of both approaches, with cloud components being upgraded automatically and on-premise components requiring manual intervention.

The text concludes by summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of each deployment option, using the analogy of owning a home versus renting an apartment. An On-Premise system is likened to owning a home, where the owner has complete control over customization but is also responsible for maintenance and upgrades. A Cloud system is compared to renting an apartment, where the tenant benefits from managed services but has limited customization options. Hybrid systems offer a balance between the two, providing flexibility and control based on the company's specific needs.



In this section, we'll talk about the deployment options.

What are the deployment options available when you're going for a.

S four Hana implementation?

There are three kinds of deployment options.

One is called on premise.

This is probably the most used kind of an implementation.

As of today.

The second is the cloud.

When you think of cloud, think of Salesforce.

What is Salesforce?

It's a completely cloud based CRM and very, very popular.

There is no software to host on your system.

It's all hosted on the cloud.

Did it have to start using it?

The next option is called hybrid option, where you have a mix of both.

So this is the most traditional option.

And still most companies prefer this run in the house.

Kind of a model.

Then mean run in the house.

It could be done in a variety of ways.

All hardware could be run in our own data center or it could be run in hosted data center.

It doesn't matter as long as you have the ownership of that box.

Right.

It could be hosted by SAP.

It could be hosted by any other provider.

But that's still.

Is treated as an on premise deployment.

With hosted.

This is the entire opposite of on premise.

It's hosted.

Bias or otherwise on a shared environment.

So it's the same software for the most part.

So there is no hardware to run.

No software to install.

It's all pre-installed for you, right?

Typically is on a pay as you go model.

Meaning Oh, I have hundred users pay $5 a month or $100 a month.

And it's not done or DC or data center.

It's we don't own the hardware.

It's it's all done on SAP or other hosted providers.

Data center.

Like I said, when you think of cloud, think of options like Salesforce.com.

Which is an example of a cloud based hosted CRM.

So no software to install, no hardware.

Pay as you go.

This is typically how cloud environments work.

And in hybrid you can have a mix of on premise and cloud.

For example, SEC could be done as on premise and CRM.

Could be on the cloud and they could be connected together using the standard interfaces.

So when do you use?

The on premise option.

Typically, when more customization is required, when more customization is required, you go for the

on premise model.

Now, when do you use this minimal customization?

This is typically cloud is like the other side of the spectrum when it comes to on premise.

On premise is on this end of the spectrum and.

Cloud is on the other end of the spectrum.

These are completely opposite beasts.

So this is something that's suitable for any kind of configuration suitable for.

If you have a heavy workload, you choose to do it in house.

If you have light workloads, you can offload it to the cloud.

For example, you don't have a lot of customization in CRM.

Offload it to the cloud.

The majority of your customization in SEC have that on premise.

Now who?

Or which kind of companies is it more suited for?

On premise is typically suited for big companies.

If you're working on a big Fortune 500 or Fortune 1000 company.

And if they are going for an sap s four Hana implementation, either Greenfield or Brownfield.

It's typically an on premise implementation or a hybrid where the majority is in house and a part of

it is on the cloud.

This is more suitable for SMEs.

Small and medium companies where there is not a huge lot of customization.

And this can be suited for any company.

You know, it doesn't matter.

So this is the hybrid approach, right?

So depending on your needs, a small company could have a lot of customization.

A big company need not have a lot of customization in those edge cases.

You can go for a hybrid case where part of it is in-house on premise, part of it, a part of it is

on the cloud.

Now what happens during an upgrade?

In case of an upgrade.

The company is responsible for the upgrade.

They have to get the appropriate license.

They have to install it.

They have to have their own basis or outsource it to some company.

Right.

They are responsible for the upgrade.

In case of a cloud.

This is the beauty.

In one way, it's all automatic, right?

You don't have to really do anything.

When it comes to an upgrade, it's upgraded for you automatically.

In S4 Hana This is done on a quarterly basis.

Automatically.

You don't have to do anything.

Of course, over here it's a mix.

In case of a cloud, it's automatic for on premise systems.

It's their own responsibility.

And when is this upgrade done for on premise systems?

Typically, the major releases are done only annually.

So for the cloud, all major releases come in quarterly because you don't have a lot of regression to

do.

This thing happens so smoothly.

And of course with hybrid, it's a mix.

But the problem with cloud, the cloud seems so beautiful actually, because you don't have to do anything.

The directors love it.

Companies love it.

The only problem is customization.

The more customization you need, the more interfaces you need.

The more companies have to go for an on premise system, they're forced to.

The cloud.

Is an option for companies.

Which fall within the reasonable limit of customization that's allowed on the cloud.

It's like this.

If you want to give me a simple example for on premise versus cloud, think of on premise as your own

home, right?

You buy your home, find a thousand, $1 million, whatever, and you are free to choose any kind of

customization that you want to do.

You want to build a wall over there by the side.

You can do it.

You want to renovate your kitchen, you can do it.

You want to build an additional garage, you can very well do it.

So that's the equivalent of an on premise system.

And you got to pay your taxes, you got to pay for your water, you got to pay for your electricity,

all that stuff.

Now in a rented home.

This is the equivalent of a cloud system.

A rented home is typically it could be a big apartment complex where there are so many different apartments.

And think of think of each apartment as an instance.

And.

In this big, huge apartment complex.

Your company software is could be residing on one of the apartment, meaning it's all part of a bigger

system.

So if there is.

A problem with the AC.

The apartment manager will take care of it.

You don't have to worry about it.

If there is a problem with water power, any of that stuff the apartment manager or the management will

take care of.

That's the advantage of cloud.

But the disadvantage is, can you do any customization in your apartment?

You can write, you can't even paint your apartment.

There are some level of customization that can be done, but it's minimal.

And some companies will go for it.

Some companies like it because of the plug and play nature of the cloud system.

And probably the future for the foreseeable future until more flexibility comes into the cloud based

systems.

Many companies might tend to go towards hybrid systems.

For example, the company that I am implementing is is a hybrid.

How much hybrid is it?

It's mostly on premise.

There is on premise.

The CRM is on premise, but there are some external systems that are customer facing.

But that interface with Ekyc and CRM and there have been put on the cloud.

So that's an example of a hybrid implementation.

So let's summarize our deployment options.

So there are three types of deployments in SAP.

S four Hana.

On premise, which is the traditional environment.

Cloud.

Think of Salesforce.com.

Everything is hosted.

No hardware, no software installs.

And hybrid, where you have a mix of both depending on your convenience and comfort.

And we have seen examples of when each of these deployment options are suitable.

What kind of companies go for each of these options?

What happens during an upgrade, what is the timing of upgrade, so on and so forth.

We have seen a simple example of on premise versus cloud.

We have taken an example of a house, a house that you own as an on premise and an apartment in an apartment

complex as a cloud system.

And based on that, you can easily visualize the advantages and disadvantages of both.
