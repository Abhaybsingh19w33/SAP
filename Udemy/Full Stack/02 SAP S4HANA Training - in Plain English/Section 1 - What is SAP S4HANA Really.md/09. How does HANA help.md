## Advantages of SAP HANA

1. **No Need for Indices**:
    - Random access is enabled by default.
    - Queries can be written on any column without creating an index.

2. **Reduction in Database Size**:
    - No storage of redundant or blank data.
    - Results in a 15 to 20 times reduction in data size.

3. **Data Storage**:
    - Data resides permanently in RAM.
    - Changes are logged onto the hard disk for backup.
    - In case of a power failure, data can be restored from the hard disk to the main memory.

4. **Speed and Performance**:
    - In-memory and column-oriented features make the database extremely fast.
    - Utilizes massively parallel processing and other features for enhanced performance.

## Impact on Traditional Database Systems

1. **Traditional OLTP Systems**:
    - Handle daily operations like creating, retrieving, changing, and deleting orders.
    - Use aggregate tables and indices for random data access.
    - Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data into OLAP systems for analysis.

2. **Traditional OLAP Systems**:
    - Optimized for querying and predefined aggregates.
    - Used to answer high-level questions and perform data analysis.

## Changes with SAP HANA

1. **Elimination of Aggregates and Indices**:
    - No need for additional aggregate tables and indices.
    - Aggregations can be performed on the fly.

2. **Single Source of Truth**:
    - Combines OLTP and OLAP functionalities into a single system.
    - No need for separate OLAP systems or data warehouses.

3. **Simplified System Landscape**:
    - Reduces the complexity of maintaining multiple systems.
    - Potentially eliminates the need for separate BW (Business Warehouse) systems, except for specific reasons.

## Conclusion

- SAP HANA provides a high-performance, in-memory, column-oriented database that simplifies data management and improves performance.
- By eliminating the need for indices and aggregates, HANA reduces database size and complexity.
- The integration of OLTP and OLAP functionalities into a single system offers a single source of truth, streamlining operations and reducing costs.

So what are the advantages of this method?

The first and primary advantage is there is no need for indices.

Because random access is enabled by default.

You can write a query on any column, any column you want.

You don't have to create an index on that.

Just gives you the results.

Number two is.

There is a huge reduction in database size because we are not storing redundant data.

We are not storing blank data.

So it is almost a 15 to 20 times reduction in the data size.

And.

Does this mean that data is not stored in the hard disk anymore?

It's all there in the Ram.

Well, true and not true.

Think of this as your memory.

Ram.

Right.

And think of this as your hard disk.

This is memory.

Ram.

This is hard disk.

Data permanently resides in the memory.

This is, let's say the database size is 500 GB.

All the 500 GB resides here.

But all the changes are logged onto the database, meaning there is a copy of that in the hard disk.

But it not used.

It's only used when there is a power failure.

What happens in a power failure.

Memories wiped out.

That's the way computers work, right?

Because memory is wiped out.

The hard disk stores a copy of what's there in the main memory at any given point in time.

So that's called logging.

Any change will be logged to the hard disk automatically.

So in case of a power failure, data can be restored from the hard disk, which has a permanency to

it.

Onto the main memory again.

Right.

So these two features in memory.

Plus.

Column oriented.

These two features make the database extremely fast.

So what is Hanna?

Hanna is an extremely fast database that's column oriented in memory and uses a whole host of other

features like massively parallel, so on and so forth.

That makes for an extremely fast database.

Now the question is what to do with that speed?

I've got a fast car.

What do you do with it?

I go to the racetrack.

Right.

So in a typical traditional database, like an OLTP system, right?

You got rows and rows of data.

And then your daily operations will be to create an order, retrieve an order, Change an order.

Delete an order.

Those are your daily operations.

On top of that, you have so many aggregate tables.

And indices.

These are all additional tables.

The purpose of which is to randomly access data based on a certain set of criteria.

Then you extract them.

Into cubes.

Big ones, small ones, multidimensional ones.

These are cubes.

So this is called ETL, extract, transform load.

And from an OLTP system you extract onto OlAp system.

Now why do you do OLTP here?

So quick?

Rights.

And reads.

That's what you need here.

And then you also have lots of operational aggregates.

All system, on the other hand, is easy to query.

Right.

And then you have predefined aggregates.

So it's easy to answer CEO level questions.

How is the structure going to change with a fast database as Hana?

If you take the table in a column oriented VBA table.

They're still going to be rose here on this picture because we can only visualize row level data, but

it's all columnar data.

With the vast database Hana which has.

Random access to any column.

There is no need for aggregates.

So all those redundant additional aggregate tables, indices tables are no longer required.

And this represents a single source of truth.

And this also means that you can do aggregation on the fly.

So no need for pre aggregates.

So.

No need for pre aggregates.

It's just a rehash of point number one.

And because there is random access, you can answer any of the level questions without having to build

an OlAp system.

So do you need a data warehouse now?

Important question, isn't it?

You can do everything that an OlAp system, a data warehouse system can do in the OLTP system itself.

And that's why it's called single source of truth.

There is no need for separate OlAp and OLTP systems.

Everything can be done in a single instance.

That's the Hana instance.

You might still need BW.

But for that's for a different set of reasons.

Overall, though, you generally don't need a different BW system.

And what happens now if you don't have a separate OlAp system?
