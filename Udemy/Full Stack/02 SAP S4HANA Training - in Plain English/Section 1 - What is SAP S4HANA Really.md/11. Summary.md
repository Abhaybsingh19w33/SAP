# Summary

## Traditional System Landscape
1. **ERP System (SAP ERP)**:
    - Handles OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) tasks.
    - Examples: Creating, retrieving, changing, and deleting orders.

2. **BW System**:
    - Handles OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) tasks.
    - Used for data consolidation and reporting.

3. **Data Marts**:
    - Built on top of BW for specific purposes (e.g., country-specific, product line-focused).

4. **Reporting Tools**:
    - Examples: Business Objects, Crystal Reports.
    - Used for generating reports based on BW data.

## Changes with SAP HANA
1. **Elimination of Separate OLAP System**:
    - Reporting, consolidation, and data marts can be done directly within the ERP system.
    - Real-time processing in the OLTP space.

2. **Single Source of Truth**:
    - All data processing and analysis are done within the ERP system.
    - Ensures data consistency and accuracy.

3. **Digital Boardroom**:
    - Provides 100% up-to-date, real-time reporting directly from the ERP system.
    - Simplifies decision-making with immediate access to data.

4. **Multi-Tenant System**:
    - HANA supports multiple systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) within the same database instance.
    - Achieved through significant data size reduction (15 to 20 times smaller).

5. **Digital Core**:
    - Core set of systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) built on HANA.
    - Real-time updates from satellite systems.
    - Eliminates the need for querying multiple systems.

## Benefits of SAP HANA
1. **Simplified System Landscape**:
    - Reduces the complexity of maintaining multiple systems.
    - Consolidates all data processing and analysis into a single system.

2. **Real-Time Data Processing**:
    - Enables immediate access to data for decision-making.
    - Supports dynamic and varied data insights.

3. **Cost Efficiency**:
    - Reduces the need for separate data warehouses and reporting tools.
    - Lowers maintenance and operational costs.

## Conclusion
- SAP HANA provides a high-performance, in-memory, column-oriented database that simplifies data management and improves performance.
- By eliminating the need for indices and aggregates, HANA reduces database size and complexity.
- The integration of OLTP and OLAP functionalities into a single system offers a single source of truth, streamlining operations and reducing costs.
- The digital boardroom concept enables real-time, data-driven decision-making.
- SAP HANA and S/4HANA are evolving rapidly, promising further advancements and improvements.

See, typically you have an ERP system, SAP, ERP, where you have the five.

And then you have a BW system.

Right.

This is the OLTP space.

This is the whole app space.

And on top of BW.

Like I said, you build datamarts.

Country specific, focused on a particular product line, so on and so forth.

And on top of that, you do business objects.

Crystal reports.

Other reporting tools.

And based off of BW you do consolidation.

Now, if you don't need an OlAp system for the reasons that we've discussed previously, you don't need

any of this stuff.

You can do reporting right out of ERP.

You can do consolidation right out of ERP.

You can do data marts right out of ERP.

Everything that can be done in the OlAp space can be done real time in the OLTP space.

This is huge.

Right.

This is called the single.

Source.

Of truth.

Point number one.

Remember, we started off.

With some marketing terms.

Single source of truth was one of them.

Another point that we discussed is the digital boardroom.

What's a digital boardroom?

You have your ERP box or OLTP system and straight out of that you can get 100% up to date, 100% real

time.

100% on the fly reporting that the boardroom typically requires.

Isn't it?

It's so easy.

Just one system.

What about your other systems?

You are not just ERP, CRM, CRM, APO.

What happens to those satellite systems?

Point number three.

Hana is a multi-tenant system.

Multi-tenant.

What is multi-tenant in the same database instance?

You can have ERP.

You can have CRM, you can have any number of tenants in the same database instance.

This is typically not how other databases work.

This is possible in Hana.

Because of what?

Because of the reduction in the data size.

Data sizes are typically 15 to 20 times smaller.

Because of that, you don't need multiple instances.

500 GB can be compressed to 50 GB.

That's a huge improvement.

Right.

So typical instances are somewhere around, you know, 300 to 1TB.

That's how a typical medium sized company is.

Instances.

In cases like that, if the database size is compressed to 50 GB.

Where do you need multiple instances?

All of them can be put together in probably a one terabyte instance.

Of Hannah.

Right.

And the next point we talked about is the digital core.

What is a digital core?

You have this core set of systems, right?

ERP.

Toyota.

SRM, EPO, whatever.

Right.

CRM.

Can have its own satellite system.

SRM can have its own satellite systems.

Same thing with another web based ordering system, let's say.

And they will come and replicate or update the database or the CRM database or the CRM database.

Now, these systems, right, these core set of systems.

When they are built on Hannah will always give you that real time updates that your systems or your

users require.

So there is no need for querying multiple satellite systems.

They all update your digital core.

This is called the digital core.

A core set of systems built on Hana that are updated by satellite systems or accompanying systems on

a real time basis.

Now your it can be more requirement focused than more focused.

No need to bother about different systems.

The user requirements become the prime driver rather than limitations.

Now let's go back to the first slide that started it all.

Right?

Run.

Simple.

Yeah, run simple.

Because there's just one small database, and that's it.

It can hold your SEC.

It can hold your CRM.

It can hold your CRM.

And that becomes your digital core.

And because there is no need for an OlAp system.

There is only one single source of truth.

And that source of truth is based on a fast multi-tenant database.

And all of this converged together in your digital boardroom?

Because because there is a single source of truth and it's extremely fast.

You can answer any parameter based query because there is only one database.

Fire away all your queries and it gives you all the answers.

So this is s four Hana now.

S four.

Hana is evolving very rapidly.

We'll talk about the evolution of Hana and the evolution of S four Hana in the next section.
