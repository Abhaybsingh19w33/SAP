# What is HANA?

## Introduction
SAP HANA is an extremely fast database that enables random access on any column. It incorporates several advanced features, including in-memory storage, column-oriented data organization, and massively parallel processing, making it a high-performance relational database management system (RDBMS).

## Core Features of HANA
1. **Speed**:
    - HANA is designed to be an extremely fast database.
    - It enables random access on any column without the need for indices.

2. **In-Memory Storage**:
    - Data resides permanently in RAM (Random Access Memory).
    - This allows for much faster data retrieval compared to traditional disk-based storage.

3. **Column-Oriented Data Organization**:
    - Data is stored by columns rather than rows.
    - This structure allows for more efficient data retrieval, especially for queries involving specific columns.

4. **Massively Parallel Processing**:
    - HANA utilizes massively parallel processing to enhance performance.
    - This allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple operations, further speeding up data processing.

## How HANA Achieves Speed
1. **In-Memory Database**:
    - Traditional databases store data on hard disks and pull parts of it into memory for operations.
    - HANA stores the entire database in memory, eliminating the need to access slower hard disks.
    - Memory (RAM) is at least 100,000 times faster than hard disk storage.

2. **Cost of RAM**:
    - The cost of RAM has decreased significantly over the years.
    - While 500 GB of RAM might be expensive for individual consumers, it is relatively affordable for businesses.
    - This reduction in cost allows entire databases to be stored in memory.

## Benefits of In-Memory Storage
1. **Faster Data Retrieval**:
    - Storing the database in memory allows for much faster data retrieval and processing.
    - This speed advantage is crucial for applications that require real-time data processing and analysis.

2. **Efficiency**:
    - By leveraging in-memory storage, HANA can perform complex queries and operations much more quickly than traditional databases.
    - This efficiency makes HANA an ideal solution for businesses that need fast and efficient data processing capabilities.

## Conclusion
SAP HANA is a high-performance database that achieves its speed through in-memory storage, column-oriented data organization, and massively parallel processing. These features enable HANA to provide rapid random access to data, making it an ideal solution for businesses that need fast and efficient data processing capabilities.


Welcome, Hannah.

What is Hannah?

Hannah is an extremely fast database.

And it enables random access on any column.

And there are many other things like in memory.

Column oriented.

Massively parallel processing and it's basically an RDBMS.

These are all the things that define Hannah.

But the core fundamental features of Hannah is that it's a fast database and it enables random access.

How does it do it?

Is what we're going to see in this chapter.

If you look at a computer, see all databases reside on a computer.

Right.

It could be a server.

It could be a simple system, complicated system.

A group of system doesn't matter.

They run on a computer.

When a computer has what?

A computer has memory.

Or Ram, as it's called, random access memory.

And typically a computer has, what, eight GB?

16 GB.

Right.

That's about the most we can imagine.

And then there is a hard disk.

This is where the memory is persisted or stored.

Your images files are stored in hard disk.

Right.

So this is what, 500 GB or one terabyte, two terabytes.

So if a database is installed, it resides on the hard disk and parts of it are being pulled into the

memory for operation.

Like if you want to run a query, you go to the hard disk, run a sequence of operations, pull it into

the main memory, and then maybe massage that data to arrive at the real value.

And here is what has been happening over the years.

Ram is getting cheaper and cheaper.

The cost of Ram is going down by a huge margin.

No 500 GB of Ram is not a big deal.

Well, it's a big deal for us, you and me as consumers.

But for a company 500 GB is no big deal.

What used to cost $1 million or was not even available can now be had for, let's say, $20,000.

That's a huge margin by which the prices have fell.

Now, when you think about 500 GB or even terabyte, the entire database can fit in here.

There is no need to put your database here in the hard disk.

You can put the entire database into the main memory.

The database is in memory now.

Now, why do you want to put the database in memory?

Memory is at least 100,000 times faster than the hard disk, so it makes sense to put the entire database

into the main memory.

So you're basically making the database 100,000 times faster.

So this is what an in-memory database does.

The entire database.

The data resides in memory, which makes it so much faster.
