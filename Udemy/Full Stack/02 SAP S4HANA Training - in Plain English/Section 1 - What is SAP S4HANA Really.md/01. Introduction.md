# Introduction

The text discusses the issue of complexity in consolidating financial statements, such as profit and loss statements or balance sheets, for large companies like GE. It highlights the challenge of converging data from numerous systems (10,000 in this case) and questions the reasons behind such complexity. The text suggests starting with the end goal in mind and understanding the factors contributing to this complexity to address the problem effectively.

In this section, we'll try and understand what is S/4HANA.

Well, just Google S/4HANA or just try to look around.

You see terms like:

- Run Simple
- Digital Boardroom
- Digital Core
- Single Source of Truth
- S/4HANA is a vast database
- S/4HANA is multi-tenant
- Merging OLAP and OLTP into one system


Like I said, once you understand the underlying technology, then you'll easily understand that there is much more to SAP S/4HANA than what hits you on the face.

So let's start real simple.

## How is an ERP System Built?

Well, we have a suite of products, right? I'm not talking about CRM. I'm just talking about the regular ERP suite. That comprises of PSD, MM, FI, CO, and so on and so forth.

So what is that?

It's basically millions of lines of code that enables you to view those screens, run the processes.

For example, when you go click a sales order via `VA01`, SAP has written so many lines of code that enables you to show the windows, run the process behind the scenes like ATP, and then save the order into the database.

The provided text is an introduction to the complexities of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, specifically focusing on SAP S/4HANA. It begins by discussing the challenges large companies face when consolidating financial statements, such as profit and loss statements or balance sheets. For example, a company like GE might need to converge data from 10,000 different systems, which is a significant challenge. The text suggests that understanding the factors contributing to this complexity is essential for addressing the problem effectively.

The author then introduces SAP S/4HANA and encourages readers to look up terms associated with it, such as "Run Simple," "Digital Boardroom," "Digital Core," "Single Source of Truth," and others. These terms are not just marketing jargon but represent real technological advancements that SAP S/4HANA brings to the table. The text promises to demystify these terms and explain the key innovations that make them possible.

The explanation then shifts to how an ERP system is built, using SAP as an example. An ERP system comprises a suite of products like PSD (Product Structure Design), MM (Materials Management), FI (Financial Accounting), and CO (Controlling). These modules are essentially millions of lines of code that enable various business processes. For instance, creating a sales order in SAP involves executing a transaction code (VA01), which triggers a complex series of operations behind the scenes, such as displaying windows, running processes like Available-to-Promise (ATP), and saving the order into the database.

The text highlights the inherent complexity of ERP systems, noting that even simple tasks like creating a sales order can involve 100,000 to 200,000 lines of code. This complexity makes it difficult to implement changes and requires highly skilled consultants to manage. The complexity arises from the intricate data structures and the extensive system landscape, which includes numerous interconnected systems like ERP, CRM, business warehouses, data marts, and various reporting and analytical tools.

The author emphasizes that maintaining such a vast system landscape is expensive and complicated. For large companies, consolidating data from thousands of systems to generate financial reports is a daunting task. This complexity is further compounded by the need to develop processes that bring all this data together, which is challenging due to the complicated data structures.

In summary, the text aims to provide an understanding of the complexity inherent in ERP systems and sets the stage for exploring how SAP S/4HANA addresses these challenges through its innovative technologies and streamlined processes.

In this section.

We'll try and understand what is as Farhana.

Well, it just Google is for Hana or just try to look around.

You see terms like this run simple digital boardroom.

Or.

Digital core.

Or you see terms like.

Single source of truth.

Or is a Hana is a vast database.

Or Hannah is.

Multi-tenant.

Right.

Or you see terms like.

A merging the OlAp and OLTP into one system.

What are these things and what makes these possible?

You might think that these are just marketing terms.

Well, these are not just marketing terms.

Once you understand the technology that's underlying s four Hana.

You'll understand the real meaning of these terms, like digital core, digital, boardroom, single

source of truth.

So in this section, we'll explore these topics and more importantly, the key innovations that make

this possible.

Essentially, we are going to demystify these terms and understand why SAP really talks about this.

And believe me, these are real.

They are not just made up terms just for marketing.

Like I said, once you understand the underlying technology, then you'll easily understand that there

is much more to sap s four Hana than what hits you on the face.

So let's start real simple.

How is an ERP system built?

Well, we have a suite of products, right?

I'm not talking about CRM.

CRM.

I'm just talking about the regular ERP suite.

That comprises of PSD, M, fi, Co, so on and so forth.

So what is that?

It's basically millions of lines of code that enables you to view those screens, run the processes.

For example, when you go click a sales order via zero one.

ASCAP has written so many lines of code that enables you to show the windows run the process behind

the scenes like ATP.

And then save the order into the database.

Same thing with processes like financial closing.

So these millions of lines of code.

Run the business logic and then ultimately store them in databases.

Like Oracle SQL.

MySQL.

Sybase.

So on and so forth.

The list goes on and on and on.

Now this.

Is as is.

This is the ERP world of SAP as it exists today.

Now in the S4 World's four Hana.

S stands for.

Sweet.

And Hannah is just a database.

We'll talk more about it.

It's the same sweet as SD fi.

PB So on and so forth.

Except.

It's running on a database called Hana.

Hana is SAP s proprietary database.

Now the ERP suite that contains Zdm five.

Are they the same?

Are they different?

We know that the database has changed.

What about the code?

Where do you see the screens and the processes?

Is it different?

Yes.

This code is being re-engineered.

For Hannah.

Well, why would you re-engineer anything for a database?

The database is just different, isn't it?

Instead of Oracle, we now have Hana instead of Microsoft SQL, we now have Hana.

Why would you re-engineer your code?

Because there is a change in the database.

ASAP is called.

Bob is supposed to be database agnostic, right?

It doesn't care what database is there.

It's database independent.

Now why did SAP re-engineer their code, their front end for a change in the back end?

The database is the functionality changing?

Are they going to introduce new sales functionality or new material management functionality?

No very minimal.

Most of it is going to be the same functionality.

Now that it's re-engineered, right?

S four Hana is being re-engineered.

All this code can only run on Hana.

With this re engineered code.

It can't run on any other database.

Not Oracle, not something else.

It only runs on Hana at least effectively.

This is the current s four Hana design.

Now the question is why?

Why bring about these changes?

Why this change?

And also, what is the business problem this new architecture solves?

And how does the new architecture solve the problems, if at all, There are problems.

Once you understand these topics, then you'll really appreciate all the marketing terms that SAP Hana

has been using all along.

Now, one of the problems with ERP systems is complexity.

ERP business problems are complex.

You'll think, for example, if you are a sales consultant, you go to zero one.

Put in your sales org order type customer material quantity.

Save.

There is almost 100 to 200,000 lines of code running behind the scenes.

To make all of that happen.

Really?

Do you need 100,000 lines of code to create a sales order?

Yes.

And that's complexity, right?

If you want to do some changes, it's not easy.

Very, very difficult.

And that's why SD consultants are consultants are paid so much.

Because to understand a change takes so much of time because the system is complicated.

Why is it complicated?

It's complicated because.

The data structures are complicated.

There is a whole host of data structures when I mean data structures.

The database tables.

The structures that are used in the code to write and read back the code, to write and read back the

data and the database tables.

The intermediary structures.

All the rest of this is all technical.

So the data structures are complicated because the type of business scenarios that particular code is

being catering.

Are complicated.

Creating a sales order is not easy, at least in the way it's being done currently.

And because the data structures are complicated.

The development process also gets complicated.

This is one aspect of complexity.

Another aspect of complexity is the landscape.

The system landscape.

It has become so huge.

That you really don't know what's happening in which system.

If you go to any big company, GE, Apple or even Tesla, the landscape of those systems is huge.

There is an ERP system, there is a CRM system, there's an ERP system, there is an CRM system, there

is a GPS system.

And on top of that there are business warehouses, data marts, reporting tools, analytical tools.

The list goes on and on and on.

Probably there are a hundred systems in production and imagine how many systems in dev, how many systems

in quality, how many systems in pre-production, how many systems on the parallel development environment.

So if a big company wants to maintain their ERP systems.

There are close to a thousand systems, including production quality, that they have to maintain on

an ongoing basis.

And they're expensive, right?

Maintaining a system is expensive.

And.

When you want to consolidate.

Not the hardware.

But for example, think about this scenario.

G Global, the one that's listed on Nasdaq or NYSE.

Wants to report their earnings.

Say they have made $100 billion this year.

What are the different entities that made that much money?

GE Plastics.

GE Superabrasives.

GE Lighting.

GE Aerospace.

GE Water.

GE Transportation.

There are so many different entities.

When combined together.

GE made $100 billion.

Right?

If just G medicals has 1000 systems, including all the environments.

Imagine the complexity.

Of trying to consolidate the revenue.

The prophet.

And all those parameters that are required to be published on Nasdaq.

From 20 different companies.

You are literally talking about 10,000 systems from which data needs to converge to create this one

statement.

Profit and loss statement or balance sheet.

Huge.

That's huge.

And again, this leads to more complexity.

You have to develop the processes that bring all these things together.

And development is complicated because of the data structures.

So complexity in terms of data structures, in terms of landscape that leads to further complication

in consolidation, that leads to further consolidation in development.

Companies are tired of this complexity.

To consolidate the GE profit and loss statement or balance sheet.

Data has to converge from 10,000 systems.

Isn't that crazy?

So we started with the end in mind.

Why this complexity?

What is making these systems complex?

So let's understand the complexity part.
