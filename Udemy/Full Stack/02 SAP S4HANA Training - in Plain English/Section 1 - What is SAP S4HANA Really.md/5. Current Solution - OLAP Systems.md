The line "Why do you worry about indices, so on and so forth?" is part of a broader discussion on the differences between OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems. In the context of data warehousing and business intelligence, indices are crucial for optimizing query performance.

In OLTP systems, indices are used to speed up the retrieval of transaction data, ensuring that operations like inserts, updates, and deletes are performed efficiently. However, in OLAP systems, the focus shifts to complex queries and data analysis. Here, indices play a different role, helping to quickly access large volumes of data across multiple dimensions.

The question posed in the line suggests a rhetorical stance, implying that in the context of OLAP systems, the traditional concerns about indices in OLTP systems might not be as critical. This is because OLAP systems are designed to handle multi-dimensional queries and are optimized for read-heavy operations, where the structure and indexing strategies differ significantly from those in OLTP systems. The phrase "so on and so forth" indicates that there are additional considerations and optimizations in OLAP systems beyond just indices, emphasizing the complexity and specialized nature of these systems.





The provided text explains the traditional approach businesses have taken to handle transaction processing and data analysis by using OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems.

In an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, which is an example of an OLTP system, various transactions take place. These transactions include creating, updating, delivering, and billing sales orders, creating production orders, updating material ledgers, and posting accounting documents. OLTP systems are designed to handle these types of transactions efficiently.

To perform data analysis, businesses typically build a parallel system called a data warehouse, which is an example of an OLAP system. A data warehouse extracts, transforms, and loads data from the OLTP system into a separate system optimized for analysis. This data warehouse contains structures known as cubes.

A cube in a data warehouse represents data in multiple dimensions. For example, a simple three-dimensional cube might have dimensions for date, material or material groups, and plant. The data inside the cube could represent sales volume, answering questions like how many units of a particular material group were sold from a specific plant on a given date. Cubes can have many dimensions, not just three, allowing for complex, multi-dimensional querying.

The database in a data warehouse is optimized for these multi-dimensional queries, enabling businesses to perform various types of analysis that are not feasible in the OLTP system. This separation of transaction processing and data analysis into OLTP and OLAP systems has been the traditional solution for managing and analyzing business data.

The text concludes by questioning the need for indices and other optimizations in the context of this traditional approach, suggesting that the current solution of using separate OLTP and OLAP systems has been effective in addressing the problem so far.






So far the businesses were building.

OlAp systems.

So this is your ERP?

Which is an example of an OLTP system.

Online transaction processing.

So this is where the transaction takes place.

OLTP.

The sales order is created, sales order is updated.

Sales order is delivered.

Sales order is billed.

Production order is created.

Material ledger is updated, accounting documents are posted.

This is all example of OLTP online transaction processing.

So businesses typically build a parallel system called a data warehouse.

It's an example of an OlAp system.

Online analytical processing.

So what's a data warehouse?

You basically extract, transform and load data into a different system called a data warehouse system,

which contains cubes.

Of data.

What's a cube?

A cube.

Is data in a number of dimensions.

A cube has dimensions, right?

Cube has three dimensions.

The cube is just used to represent things visually for you.

But a cube in data warehouse can have any number of dimensions.

The structure of a cube is like this.

So this is one dimension.

For example, let's take a simple three dimensional cube.

This is one dimension, a dimension of, say, date.

This is another dimension, dimension of, say, material or material groups.

And this is, say, the dimension of plan.

And the data inside is probably, say, sales volume.

So how many units of a particular material group have we sold from a plant on this date?

That's what this cube answers.

So you can build n different kinds of cubes, not just three dimensions, multi dimensional, ten dimensions.

20 dimensions.

Sure.

So the database in a data warehouse is optimized for multi dimensional querying.

So we have OLTP where you make transactions and you go to a different system where data is extracted

from the main ERP and you do different kinds of analysis because that system is built for analysis.

This guy.

So what is the problem?

That's how businesses have solved the problem so far.

So it's a big deal.

Why do you worry about indices, so on and so forth?
