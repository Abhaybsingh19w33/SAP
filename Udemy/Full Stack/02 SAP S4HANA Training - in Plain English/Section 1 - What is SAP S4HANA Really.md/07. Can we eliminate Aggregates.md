The line "What if there is a database that is so fast that random access is fast?" poses a hypothetical scenario in which a database is optimized to provide extremely quick random access to its columns. In traditional databases, random access can be slow due to the need to build and maintain indexes, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially when updates are frequent.

The idea here is to imagine a database that overcomes these limitations, allowing for rapid retrieval of data from any column without the usual performance penalties. This would be particularly beneficial in situations where business requirements are unpredictable, and analysts need to perform ad-hoc queries on various columns without prior indexing.

Such a database would significantly enhance the flexibility and efficiency of data analysis, enabling users to quickly access and analyze data based on evolving needs without the overhead of maintaining complex indexing structures. This could lead to more agile and responsive decision-making processes, as data retrieval would no longer be a bottleneck.







The provided text discusses the complexity inherent in traditional database systems, particularly focusing on the issues related to aggregates and the overall system landscape. It begins by identifying the primary sources of complexity: development, database management, and the landscape of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) versus OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems. The text highlights that one of the main drivers of landscape-related issues is the existence of multiple systems, including third-party systems, subsystems, and satellite systems like CRM (Customer Relationship Management). These multiple sources of truth contribute to the complexity of the landscape.

The text explains that OLAP systems are not simple either. They often include a primary data warehouse and various data marts, which are built for specific countries or lines of business. These data marts provide delayed access to the same database, essentially offering different representations of the main ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. This setup leads to further complexity, particularly in terms of data consolidation, as illustrated by the example of GE and its challenges with consolidating data from numerous systems.

To address this complexity, SAP identified aggregates as the root cause. Aggregates are used to facilitate random access to the database, but they also contribute significantly to the system's complexity. While indexes were introduced to solve some of the problems associated with aggregates, they cannot address all issues. Indexes provide random access to specific columns, but building and maintaining them is resource-intensive and cannot anticipate all future business requirements.

The text then poses a hypothetical solution: what if there were a database so fast that it could provide random access to any column without the need for aggregates or extensive indexing? This would eliminate the need for aggregates and significantly reduce the complexity of the system. The idea is to have a database that can handle random access efficiently, thereby simplifying the overall architecture and making it easier to manage and develop.







If you come back to the original problem of complexity.

Complexity with development.

Complexity with the database.

And we said the main problem here is aggregates.

All right, Then we said there is a problem with landscape.

The whole app.

Versus OLTP.

Is one of the primary drivers of landscape related issues.

There are many other reasons, like third party systems, subsystems, satellite systems like CRM,

CRM that increase the complexity in the landscape.

But this is one of the prime drivers of landscape issues.

There are too many sources of truth.

There is an OlAp system, there is an OLTP system.

OlAp systems are not simple either.

There is a primary data warehouse and then there are specific data marts.

Data marts that are built locally for a particular country.

Data marts that are built for a particular line of business.

And they are all delayed access to the same database.

They're basically different representations of the same OLTP, the main ERP.

And another problem we said is consolidation, remember?

And we talked about the problem of GE and why consolidation is a problem with a company like that.

So how to beat this complexity?

So SAP started with the first problem that started it all aggregates.

Aggregates is the root cause of all this complexity.

And indexes were built to solve some of the problems, but it can't solve everything.

So SAP said, Can we remove these aggregates altogether?

So let's come back.

Why do we need aggregates?

We need aggregates because we need random access.

To database because.

Access is very slow record by record unless you have an index.

And you can build indexes on every column.

So building indexes.

You can get random access with index, but building indexes is expensive because building it is easy,

but updating it is like an aggregate operation.

And you cannot predict the business requirements to build an index.

You can build it based on some historical references saying you need this column, that column, so

on and so forth, but you can't really predict all the requirements because like I said, think of that

SEO scenario is trying to analyze based on, well, you don't know what he's going to analyze based

on.

Right.

So the solution is what if?

There is a database that is so fast that you can get random access on any column.

The problem is random access to columns in the database.

What if there is a database that is so fast that random access is fast?
