# Why Index Tables Don't Solve All the Problems

In the context of the document, the author has been discussing the limitations of index tables in database design, particularly how they cannot accommodate every possible query or random access need. By stating "Let's take an example," the author is preparing to demonstrate these limitations in a practical, easy-to-understand manner. This approach helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice, making the information more accessible and engaging for the reader.

## Example: Searching for Orders in a Database

Imagine you have a database table that stores order information. This table includes columns such as `order_number`, `order_date`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, and `total_amount`.

### Scenario 1: Simple Search

You frequently need to search for orders by `order_number`. Since this is a common query, you create an index on the `order_number` column. This index allows the database to quickly locate orders by their number, significantly speeding up the search process.

### Scenario 2: Complex Search

Now, suppose the CEO asks for a report on sales by a specific combination of criteria, such as:

- Orders placed by a particular customer (`customer_id`)
- Within a specific date range (`order_date`)
- For a specific product (`product_id`)

To handle this query efficiently, you might need to create a composite index that includes `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `product_id`. However, creating such an index assumes that you know in advance that this combination of criteria will be frequently queried.

### Limitation

The problem arises when the CEO asks for a different combination of criteria that you did not anticipate, such as:

- Orders with a total amount greater than a certain value (`total_amount`)
- Placed within the last month (`order_date`)
- By customers from a specific region (which might require joining with another table to get customer region information)

In this case, the existing indexes may not be sufficient to optimize the query, leading to slower performance. You can't create indexes for every possible combination of search criteria because:

- It would require an enormous amount of storage space.
- It would complicate the database design and maintenance.
- It would slow down write operations, as each index needs to be updated whenever data is inserted, updated, or deleted.

### Conclusion

This example illustrates that while indexes can significantly improve query performance for known and frequently used search criteria, they cannot solve all problems. The need for random access to data and the ability to handle ad-hoc queries means that you can't rely solely on indexes. Instead, you need a balanced approach that includes proper database design, query optimization, and sometimes even additional hardware resources.






The provided text discusses the limitations of using index tables to solve the problems associated with large databases and long access times. It begins by acknowledging that one way to address the issue of huge database sizes is by investing in more hardware, such as additional RAM, CPUs, hard disks, and power. This approach can mitigate the problem of large databases to some extent.

However, the text points out that long database access times can also be addressed by building more indices on frequently accessed columns. Indices help speed up data retrieval by providing quick pointers to the exact locations of the data in the main table. For example, creating an index on the order number column allows for faster searches based on order numbers. But this solution has its limitations.

Building an index on a table assumes that you know in advance which columns will be frequently accessed. For instance, while it might be clear that searching by order number is important, there could be 200 to 300 different columns in a table. Deciding which columns to index is often based on historical usage patterns and educated guesses. This approach is not foolproof, as future queries might require searches on columns that were not indexed, leading to inefficiencies.

The text highlights that creating indices on all columns is impractical due to the significant overhead involved. There is a limit to how many indices can be built on a table, especially one with a large number of columns. This limitation means that random access to data and comprehensive analysis is constrained by the initial design choices regarding which columns to index.

The example provided illustrates this point further. If a CEO wants to analyze sales data based on various criteria, they might need to access any of the 300 unique fields in the sales system. However, if indices were not built on the specific columns required for the analysis, it becomes challenging to retrieve the necessary data efficiently. This technological limitation restricts the ability to perform ad-hoc analyses on any column, thereby limiting the insights that can be derived from the data.

In summary, while indices can improve data retrieval times, they are not a panacea for all database access problems. The need to preemptively decide which columns to index based on historical usage patterns means that the system's design inherently limits the flexibility and comprehensiveness of data analysis. This limitation poses a significant challenge for businesses that require dynamic and varied data insights.







Now huge database size can be solved by buying more hardware. You go for more RAM, more CPU, more hard disk, more power.

Now huge database size can be solved by buying more hardware.

You go for more Ram, more CPU, more hard disk, more power.

That's all the huge database problem.

No long database access times can also be solved by building more indices to a reasonable extent.

You create indices on this table, on this column.

This column.

This column.

The most frequently accessed ones.

But here is the problem.

Building an index on a table assumes that you know what you're looking for.

For example, order number searching by order number is a very important search criteria, so you can

build on that.

But if you take K, there are close to 200 or 300 different columns.

You can make an assessment and say, okay, I'm going to need searches on these columns and then build

indices on them.

But is that the right thing to do?

How do you know that somebody else in the future does not want to look on a particular column that is

not indexed?

So basically, you can utmost make a guess.

On the most used columns and build indices on them.

Because like I said, you don't want to build indexes or indices on all columns.

That's just foolish.

It's so much of an overhead.

There is only a limit to how many indices that you can build on a table, at least as large as 300 columns.

And when you build indices, it's purely guesswork.

You are building indices or index on a column.

That you, you know, might be used.

Or might not be used.

You can just go by historical references or.

Historically, this is how the search was used.

So let's build indices on these columns.

The question is, what if you don't know what the user is looking for?

Let me give you an example.

Say.

The CEO wants to analyze the sales based on a number of different criteria.

Right.

In VBA, K.

There are 300 plus fields and we say 100 plus fields and we add.

Let's say 100.

We have 500.

Let's.

Accounting for redundancy.

There are, let's say, 300 unique fields in the sales system, order header, order line item, business

data, so on and so forth.

Now the CEO or whoever is in the analytics team might want to analyze on any column.

Because the data is there.

Why not analyze it?

Just because we don't have indices, we can't analyze data based on any of the columns.

Because you can't build indices on all the columns.

It's a very expensive operation.

So the technology here is limiting.

The analysis that you can do.

You can do analysis on any column.

Right.

So let's come all the way from the beginning.

So there is aggregate tables.

Which results in huge database sizes.

And then because of that, more indices.

But at the end of it.

Random access to anything.

Is limited only by your design.

You can only design based on a certain number of criteria.

You can't design for everything, so random access to data and analysis is not possible.

So what were the businesses doing so far?

Because.

The CEO needs answers to all different kinds of questions.

He'll just ask you, I need sales by this particular combination.

And if you don't have it, what are you going to do?

Let's take an example.
