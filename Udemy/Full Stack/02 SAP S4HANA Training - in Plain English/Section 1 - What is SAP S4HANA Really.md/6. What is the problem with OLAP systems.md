The provided line of text, "So a predicted number of variables can be used for analysis," suggests that in the context of data analysis, it is possible to use a set of variables that have been forecasted or estimated. This implies that the analysis is not limited to just the current or historical data but can also incorporate future projections or predictions.

In data analysis, especially in fields like predictive analytics or machine learning, it is common to use models to predict future values based on historical data. These predicted values, or variables, can then be included in the analysis to gain insights into potential future trends or outcomes. This approach allows analysts to make more informed decisions by considering not only what has happened in the past but also what is likely to happen in the future.

By incorporating predicted variables, analysts can perform more comprehensive and forward-looking analyses, which can be particularly valuable in strategic planning, forecasting, and decision-making processes.






The provided text discusses the inherent problems with OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems in the context of data analysis and decision-making. It begins by highlighting that OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, serve as the primary source of truth for business data. These systems handle real-time transactions and updates, ensuring that the data is current and accurate.

However, OLAP systems, which are used for data analysis, operate on data that is extracted, transformed, and loaded from OLTP systems. This process is not instantaneous and typically occurs during off-peak hours, such as overnight, to avoid overloading the OLTP systems. As a result, the data in OLAP systems is often delayed by at least 12 hours, if not a full day. This delay means that the data used for analysis is not up-to-date, leading to the first problem: OLAP systems provide stale data that is not current.

The second problem with OLAP systems is their inability to handle unpredictable queries effectively. For example, if a CEO wants to analyze sales trends and correlate them with various factors such as plant outputs, labor issues, and goods issues, they might ask for year-on-year sales data broken down by plant and date. The challenge arises because the CEO's queries can be unpredictable, and the parameters they want to analyze may not have been predefined in the OLAP system.

In a scenario like a digital boardroom, where key decision-makers such as the CEO or CTO are asking questions and expecting immediate answers, the limitations of OLAP systems become apparent. If the CEO asks for data based on a parameter that was not pre-built into the OLAP system, such as the reason for order rejections, the system cannot provide the answer. This is because OLAP systems are designed to handle a predefined set of variables, and it is impractical to build a system that can query every possible parameter due to the sheer number of variables involved.

In summary, the text outlines two major problems with OLAP systems: they provide outdated data due to the delay in data extraction and loading, and they are limited in their ability to handle queries based on unpredictable parameters. These limitations hinder the effectiveness of OLAP systems in providing timely and comprehensive data analysis for decision-making.






The problem is.

OLTP, your ERP is the source of truth.

This is the only source of truth.

Typically, there could be other systems, feeder systems or, you know, parallel systems.

But typically they are all OLTP, not just ERP.

Any other accompanying system but OlAp.

Is a parallel system that has.

Delayed access.

It's not real time, isn't it?

Because, you know, this transformation extraction loading takes time.

So typically they are done overnight.

When the ERP system is not very busy.

So this is delayed, if not by a day, at least by 12 hours.

Another problem.

So this is the first problem.

Not up to date.

Still data.

The second problem is.

So, for example, you want to analyze the sales trends and correlate them to the plant outputs, labor

problems, you know, goods issues, so on and so forth.

So the CEO is asking you, give me the year on year sales between 20.

Say ten and 2015.

Break it down by plant and he's going to give a pause and say and say date.

Because he is trying to analyze a real world problem and he's trying to see what are all the parameters

that he need to query the data to give the data that he requires.

And.

He doesn't know.

It could be anything, any field that is related to sales.

So you can't predict his query.

You don't know what his next parameter is going to be.

So here is a simple example of a digital boardroom.

A digital boardroom is just.

A room with people and PowerPoints and reports being projected on the wall where the key people at the

CEO or CTO is asking questions and the analytics team or somebody in the CTO team will be answering

because they're trying to solve a problem.

So here is a simple example.

There is a digital boardroom.

And the CEO is sitting there with a problem.

He wants to increase sales.

So he asks a question.

Okay.

The problem is we want to increase sales for this quarter.

And we want to analyze what are the parameters that we can tweak to increase the sales.

The CTO is ready.

Okay, sir, what do you want?

I want to analyze the sales for the past ten years.

By these parameters, plan, date, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

And he just throws those variables in there.

And the CTO can only answer plant and date.

He cannot answer, say, for example, a reason for rejection.

How many people have rejected orders in the past?

If that parameter was not built into the cube.

Meaning pre-built.

It has to be built.

Somebody has to build it.

The CTO cannot answer the question, so he draws a blank face.

Meaning he only has answers to predefined questions.

The parameters need to be predefined and you can't define it for every parameter, just like the way

you can't build indices for every column in the table.

Right?

So that is problem number three.

OlAp systems.

Or based on.

Predicted number of variables.

Given a set of variables, it can build a system that can let you query based on those parameters.

But they can't build it for every parameter.

That's not possible.

There are 500 parameters for a sales order.

You cannot build a system that can be queried based on any of those parameters.

Right.

This is the second problem.

So the first problem was an OlAp system is not up to date.

And the second problem with OlAp system is it's not built to query based on every parameter.

There are limitations.

So a predicted number of variables can be used for analysis.
