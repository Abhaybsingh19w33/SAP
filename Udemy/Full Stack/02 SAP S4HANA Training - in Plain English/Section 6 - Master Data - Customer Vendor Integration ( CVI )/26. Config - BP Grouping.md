# Configuring BP Grouping in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section focuses on the configuration of Business Partner (BP) grouping and number ranges in SAP S/4HANA.

## Configuration Location
### Navigation Path
1. **SAP Implementation Guide (IMG)**
2. **Cross-Application Components**
3. **SAP Business Partner**
4. **Basic Settings**
5. **Number Ranges and Groupings**

## BP Grouping
### Definition
- **BP Grouping**: Similar to customer account groups or vendor account groups, used for defining number ranges and synchronization between BP and customer master data.

### Usage
- **Initial Creation**: The grouping field is visible only during the initial creation of a BP.
- **Example**: Creating a new BP named "Google Inc." and saving it assigns a BP number based on the specified grouping.

## Number Ranges
### Types
- **Internal Number Ranges**: Automatically assigned by the system.
- **External Number Ranges**: Manually entered by the user.

### Configuration
1. **Define Intervals**: Create intervals for internal and external number ranges.
   - **Internal Example**: 01 (1 to 999999)
   - **External Example**: A to Z (A, B, C, etc.)

2. **Associate Grouping with Number Range**: Create a new grouping and associate it with a specific number range.
   - **Example**: Grouping "Z001" with internal number range "01."

### Hiding Groupings
- **Purpose**: Hide groupings that are not yet needed to prevent inadvertent creation of BPs.
- **Example**: Preparing for a new line of business but starting it next month.

## Default Groupings
### Internal Standard Grouping
- **Default Internal Grouping**: Used when no grouping is specified during BP creation.
- **Example**: Grouping "0001" with number range "01."

### External Standard Grouping
- **Default External Grouping**: Used when an external number is entered without a grouping.
- **Example**: Grouping "0002" with external number range "A, B, C."

## Practical Demonstration
### Creating a BP
1. **Transaction Code**: BP
2. **Create Organization**: Select BP category as "Organization."
3. **Enter Basic Information**: Name, address, etc.
4. **Save**: BP number is assigned based on the grouping.

### Extending to Customer or Vendor
1. **Change Mode**: Enable editing.
2. **Add Role**: Extend BP to customer or vendor by adding roles (e.g., FLCU01 for customer sales view, FLVN00 for vendor finance view).
3. **Save**: Data is stored in corresponding tables (e.g., KNB1, LFB1).

## Conclusion
### Summary
- **BP Grouping**: Controls number ranges and synchronization.
- **Number Ranges**: Can be internal or external, associated with specific groupings.
- **Default Groupings**: Simplify the creation process by using default internal or external groupings.

### Next Steps
- **Configuration**: Future chapters will cover more detailed configuration of business partners.
- **Data Migration**: Discussion on data migration from ECC to S/4HANA.

So far.

We have seen what is a business partner.

What are rolls?

How roles roughly represent the views either in the customer or the vendor, and how data is stored

behind the scenes in tables.

Now from this chapter.

We are going to focus on the configuration.

So where is the configuration for business partner?

So go to Sparrow.

IMG.

And typically the business partner configuration is in logistics general.

The old world of vendors, customers, account groups.

The new business partner is in cross-application components, right?

Cross-application components.

And under that, go to SAP business.

SAP Business partner.

So here you have business partner.

Right.

So this is business partner configuration for either customer or vendor.

Go to business partner.

Basic settings.

Then.

Go to number ranges and groupings.

So the first piece of configuration is BP grouping.

What is a BP group?

If you go create a new BP.

You have something here called the group?

And this will only be visible when you try to create for the first time.

For example, we are creating a new BP.

Say Google Inc.

Right.

And then doing nothing else.

Observe this field grouping.

I'm just saving it.

Okay.

Business partner 64 is created and that's it.

Irrespective of if I'm in change mode or display mode, that grouping doesn't appear anymore.

It only appears for the first time.

So this basically plays a role similar to.

Customer account group or vendor account group.

Remember 0001 customer account group is sold 20002 is something else.

Same with vendor.

This plays a similar role.

And it's mainly used for number ranges.

And synchronization.

Synchronization between BP and customer master.

We'll talk about it later.

So the first thing it plays a role similar to customer account group.

So what is a customer account group do?

If you try to create a customer master, what is the first thing that you do?

Go to zero one.

And first dropdown there will be customer account group.

You select a customer account group.

Meaning are specifying what kind of customer you are creating.

Are you creating a sole two or are you creating a one time customer?

Are you creating a payer?

So on and so forth.

And the customer account group is very tightly associated with the number range because that is where

the number range is defined.

At the BP grouping controls number ranges.

So let's see how these are defined.

So number ranges, you know what number ranges are.

We define intervals and call them either as internal or external.

So in case of internal, this is defined as zero one number range from 1 to 999.

Right.

And then in case of external, this is defined as A to Z and the number range is a, B, This is a very

small number range.

Ideally, it should be somewhere 99999.

Right.

So you can go change that to 999999.

Say, say at least two.

Nein, nein, nein.

And there is overlap.

So let me not bother about it now.

So these are number ranges.

Now.

A grouping is associated with number range.

The grouping that we typically use for BP is internal is 0001.

So you can go ahead and create any grouping you like.

So for example, you create a new grouping.

The 001.

Then give it a name.

New BP and then some description.

Right.

And then we want it to be internal number Range zero one.

Right.

And.

Save it.

So this is a config, so save it as a transport.

Now go back slash NB because we want to go all the way back and come again because changes need to be

reflected, right?

And then go to new organization and over here.

See that new Z001.

We use that the number range that you specified there will be used.

Okay.

Another feature is there's something called as hide.

So we click on hide and click on Save.

And then go back all the way, slash n beep and come again.

Click on new org over here and this role you see that new that role is hidden.

You no longer see it.

You see 001 because drop down keys are enabled.

You can disable them by going here.

Options.

Keyboard visualization.

If you delete that, click apply.

Okay.

So when you go to BP again.

Click on new org.

This should no longer be visible.

Right.

Do you see that You don't see Z001.

Right?

Now, why do you want to hide a business partner grouping?

You want to hide it?

In case new vendor groups or new customer account groups are needed.

But you're starting it next month.

Say you want to create a new type, but you want to start it next month.

Say you're starting a new line of business agency business, but you don't.

You're not starting it yet.

You're starting it starting from next month.

So in between, you can have all the configuration ready.

But keep it hidden so that users don't create those business partners, you know, inadvertently.

They can just go about their business.

The new agency partner will not be visible in that dropdown for grouping and when you are ready.

Go and switch.

Switch off the hide like so.

And then save it.

Move the transport to production and the new business partner grouping will be available.

The next thing is internal standard grouping and external standard grouping.

And there is something called as a default internal standard grouping and default external standard

grouping.

What is a default internal standard grouping?

In this case, 0001.

Is the default internal standard grouping and it has a number range of zero one.

That means if you create a business partner.

Like slash nbp.

New Ark.

And if you block this out, you don't enter anything.

All right.

This is a customer say agency.

One.

Okay.

Save it.

You have not selected any grouping.

Right.

And it has given you a business partner number of 71.

Why 71?

Because if you don't select a grouping, the default grouping is going to be used as 0001, and that

has a number range of zero one.

And the number over there started with 70.

So that was the new number that was available in that range.

Same thing with external.

If you want to use an external number range, there is a default external standard grouping.

No, I've never used default external standard grouping, but the way to do that is very simple.

Go to external and don't enter any grouping here.

Instead, just put in a BCD or agency one.

Age and agency one.

Right.

And then.

Agency two.

This is external number range, right?

So when you put an external number here, the default external number range will be used.

So agent is created and that is created because when you put in a number, the default external number

range of a B was picked up.

So the group is going to be 0002.

Now if you go to C 16.

Good, but 000.

And the one that we have created previously was 70 and the one that we have created later as an external

grouping was Asian.

Right.

So go there and execute.

So again uses grouping 0002.

And what was the other one?

Wasn't it 70 or was it 69?

So what was the one that we have created, let's say.

Search by name.

What was the name that we have created?

Six.

For, I think.

Or we did not create one.

Let's create that again.

I think 70 was not created somehow.

So we're not choosing any grouping and saying agency to.

Okay.

Save.

The number is 72.

So let's go here.

Go back and select Agency 70 to the point that I want to show is.

When you create a business partner without specifying a grouping, and if you leave the number blank,

it chooses a default internal grouping.

And if you put something in, it chooses a default external grouping.

Right.

And I want to show you the default grouping that was used for each of these cases.

Now again, why do you want to use that default?

External default Internal?

Most of the time you might not want, you know, different number ranges because grouping doesn't really

do much other than number ranges.

Customer account group, on the other hand, does a lot of things.

Customer account.

Group.

Vendor Account Group.

You know, it controls the way the customer behaves, the screens, the layouts, hiding fields, so

many different things.

But grouping has a much smaller functionality.

It just defines number ranges.

And defines which one of them is standard among internal and external.

That's it.

Okay.

So most of the time you might not ask the customer or user to really enter a grouping.

You can just say, just go ahead.

Focus on your roles will take care of the numbers.

So by default, it starts with a certain number range.

And that number range is the default internal number range.

So anytime a new customer is created, don't enter any grouping, just keep going and it will choose

the default internal number range.

It's just one step less.

That's it.

For the users creating these transactions.

And I talked a little bit about synchronization.

Right.

We'll talk more about it later.

But BP group plays a critical role when migrating customers or vendors in SEC to BP's.

And it also plays a critical role when you create BP's and give it roles to make entries as customers

or vendors.

So we'll talk more about that later.
