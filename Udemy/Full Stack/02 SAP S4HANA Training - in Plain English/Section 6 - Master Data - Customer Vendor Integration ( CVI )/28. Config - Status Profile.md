# Configuring Status Profile in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section focuses on the configuration of status management for Business Partners (BP) in SAP S/4HANA.

## Status Management
### Concept
- **Status Profile**: A list of statuses that a business partner can go through, such as "approved," "rejected," "onboarded," etc.
- **Usage**: Allows for more granular control over the lifecycle of a BP.

### Traditional Use
- **Sales Documents**: Status profiles have been used in sales document headers and items.
- **Customer/Vendor Masters**: Did not have status profiles in traditional SAP ERP systems.

### Modern Use
- **Business Partner**: Now includes a status profile in SAP S/4HANA.

## Practical Example
### Scenario
- **E-commerce Business**: Onboarding wholesale distributors.
- **Statuses**: Onboarded, Portal access granted, Buyer profile generated, Training complete, Ready.

### Steps
1. **Create BP**: Create a new BP for "Ingram Micro Distributors."
2. **Assign Status**: Initially assign the status "Onboarded."
3. **Update Status**: As the distributor progresses, update the status to "Portal access granted," "Buyer profile generated," "Training complete," and finally "Ready."
4. **Control Transactions**: Ensure that the distributor can only place orders once they reach the "Ready" status.

## Configuration
### Navigation Path
1. **SAP Implementation Guide (IMG)**
2. **Cross-Application Components**
3. **SAP Business Partner**
4. **Basic Settings**
5. **Status Management**
6. **Define Status Profile**

### Example Configuration
1. **Create Status Profile**: Create a status profile named "Z_DIST" for distributors.
2. **Define Statuses**: Include statuses such as "Onboarded," "Portal access granted," "Buyer profile generated," "Training complete," and "Ready."
3. **Assign to Object Type**: Assign the status profile to the business partner object type.

## Practical Demonstration
### Creating a BP
1. **Transaction Code**: BP
2. **Create Organization**: Select BP category as "Organization."
3. **Enter Basic Information**: Name, address, etc.
4. **Assign Status**: Assign the initial status "Onboarded."
5. **Save**: BP is created with the specified status.

### Updating Status
1. **Change Mode**: Enable editing.
2. **Update Status**: Change the status to "Portal access granted," "Buyer profile generated," "Training complete," and "Ready" as the distributor progresses.
3. **Save**: Each status update is saved.

## Conclusion
### Summary
- **Status Profile**: Allows for granular control over the lifecycle of a business partner.
- **Configuration**: Status profiles are configured and assigned to business partners to control their activities.
- **Usage**: Ensures that business partners meet all necessary criteria before engaging in specific transactions.

### Next Steps
- **Configuration**: Future chapters will cover more detailed configuration of business partners.
- **Data Migration**: Discussion on data migration from ECC to S/4HANA.
The next topic.

Is status management.

Now, this is a concept.

There has already existed in EQ a sales document header header status profile.

A sales document item had a status profile.

But the business partner or customer master did not have a status profile.

Neither did the vendor master.

Inez, foreign business partner, now has a status profile.

Now, I'm not going to go into the configuration behind status profile because that is something that

already existed since ages.

And you know why?

Status profile is used in business documents like sales order item.

Isn't it?

A sales document goes through an approval cycle.

That's one example of how we use status management.

Now in the context of business partner.

How do you use status profile?

The concept is really simple.

You have a business partner.

Each business partner can be associated with a status profile.

Why would you want to use it?

A status profile is simply.

A list of statuses.

For example.

Status is approved.

Status is rejected.

Status is onboarded, so on and so forth.

We'll see an example.

And it goes from one step to another.

Like.

So.

Like so.

Or.

Like so.

And it can also go back.

One step or two steps or ten steps.

Let's take an example.

And see how we can use that in the business partner.

See we are running.

An e-commerce business.

And we are onboarding customers.

As a wholesale.

Distributors.

Right.

So we are running a website, an e-commerce website.

And we are onboarding distributors.

So what do we need to do first?

We need to onboard a distributor.

We need to bring him on board, introduce him them to the portal, so on and so forth.

Explain the profitability.

Explain the margins.

Explain the procedures.

And then we have to train them.

On the program, meaning the e-commerce program, you know how the logins work, so on and so forth.

Right.

And then maybe give them the login password.

And then.

After the training is completed.

Maybe we say the customer is active or ready.

3 or 4 different statuses.

Right.

And until the customer is active or distributor is active, we don't let that customer do a transaction

like place a sales order.

Because he has got to be onboarded, trained and he should have a proper login.

And that check can be done in one of the user exits.

Saying if unless a business partner status is active, which we can get programmatically.

Will not allow that customer to place orders or distributor to place orders.

Is that clear?

This is called status management.

And we have been using status management in SD for quite some time.

Right?

Only at the document level.

Now, as for Hana is allowing us to use status profile the same concept with business partners.

Now let us see an example.

Go to.

And create, let's say, an org.

Okay.

Create an arc.

And let's say Ingram Micro Distributors.

All right.

And now if you go to status.

And.

You see, these are the statuses.

So I've already created some configuration because I don't want you to show the configuration here.

This is something that you already know.

I just want you to see how you can apply the status profile to a business partner.

For example, we have just Onboarded Ingram Micro, so select that click.

Okay.

And click save.

Business partner.

92 is created.

Okay, good.

Now, a couple of days down the line, one of our sales reps or one of our onboarding partners have

called Ingram Micro and said.

You know what?

This is the portal that you're going to be using from our company to place orders.

And here is your user ID and password.

Okay, so we're going to go.

The customer change.

Select that and click on portal access.

Granted, the status has been changed now and save.

So after that, maybe for a week the distributor will just play around and understand the portal and

once he's comfortable, we'll generate what is called as a buyer profile.

So that will link the distributors, bank accounts and all that stuff in the portal.

Okay.

So the next step is.

Changing the status to buyer profile generated.

So you do that.

All right, Save it.

And once that is done, he has to go through a formal training program.

So he comes to our place or there is a website that he can attend via WebEx and he gets trained.

So once the training is done, we change the status.

To training complete.

Right.

Once the training is complete, then he can start placing orders.

Right.

Now, if you're wondering how that is controlled.

Meaning unless the business partner Ingram Micro is in the status.

Training complete.

Will not allow that person to order or that entity to order.

How is that controlled?

That is controlled in the user exits via programming.

So there are four statuses.

And when you place an order in VR zero 1 in 1 of the user exit.

The Abap programmer will write code.

That will look at the status profile.

Associated with the soul to.

Get the current status.

And if the status is active.

Only then let the customer place an order.

If not, don't allow the customer to place an order as simple as that.

Right.

That's all technical.

But what you have to understand as a functional consultant is that the user profile can be configured

and assigned to the business partner.

Now, how do you configure the user profile is something that you should already be aware of as an XG

consultant or a consultant?

What I'm going to show you now is an example that I have created and assigned to the business partner.

So where do you configure that?

As usual.

Go to Sbarro.

IMG.

And cross application components.

Go to business partner.

Business partner.

Basic settings.

And go to status management.

Define status profile.

Now, I have created a status profile here.

Called Z dist z dist for distributed.

And if you double click that, you'll see that these are the statuses I've created.

Right.

Onboarded Portal access granted via profile generated training complete ready five different statuses.

And then you should already know how these lowest and highest statuses work.

Right, and what is the initial status, so on and so forth.

These are things that you should already be aware of.

If not, you can go to any SD standard, SD or RM training and you'll be aware of this.

The key thing to understand here is.

When you create a status profile, for example, for a sales document order, you assign the status

profile to that particular object type.

Right.

It should be a sales document, header, sales document items, so on and so forth.

Now, when you create a status profile for a business partner, you assign that to what kind of object?

Business partner.

Now, unless you do this, it will not work.

Okay.

So make sure that the status profile that you have created is assigned to the allowed object type of

business partner.

And these are all the different technical object types that can be associated with the status profile.

Right.

In this case, we are using that to a business partner.

And once you do that, your status will become active in the business partner.

So this is how you use status profile with business partners.
