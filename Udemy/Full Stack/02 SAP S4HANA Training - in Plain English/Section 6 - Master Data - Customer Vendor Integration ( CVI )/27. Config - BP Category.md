# Configuring BP Category in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section focuses on the configuration of Business Partner (BP) categories in SAP S/4HANA.

## BP Category
### Definition
- **BP Category**: Specifies whether the BP is a person, an organization, or a group. This categorization is hard-coded and cannot be expanded beyond these three options.

### Usage
- **Person**: Represents an individual.
- **Organization**: Represents a company or business entity.
- **Group**: Represents a collection of people, such as a syndicate or purchasing group.

## Traditional vs. Modern Use Cases
### Traditional B2B Perspective
- **Customers as Organizations**: Companies like Google, Facebook, and GE are considered customers.
- **Individuals**: Typically not considered customers but may be contact persons or employees.

### B2C and New Dimension Scenarios
- **Banking and Real Estate**: Customers and vendors can be individuals or groups.
- **Examples**:
  - **Person**: A solo supplier or a shopper on an e-commerce platform.
  - **Group**: A syndicate or a purchasing group.

## Differences Between Categories
- **Person**: Does not have a VAT registration number, but has attributes like gender, nationality, and marital status.
- **Organization**: Does not have attributes like gender or marital status but has a VAT registration number.
- **Group**: Represents a collection of individuals engaging in business transactions collectively.

4. **Save**: BP is created with the specified category.

## Conclusion
### Summary

- **Attributes**: Different attributes are configured based on the category.
- **Usage**: Categories are used differently in B2B and B2C scenarios.

### Next Steps
- **Configuration**: Future chapters will cover more detailed configuration of business partners.

The second piece of config is called BP category.

When you create a BP, the first thing that you'll be doing, let's go back all the way.

So go to BP.

And the first thing that you do when you create a new app is you have to specify if you're creating

a new person.

Or a new org or a new group person.

Org group.

This is called as category.

And you can create new categories.

This is hard coded BP category.

The first thing is this is hard coded.

You can create more of these.

And there are just three of them.

Either a person.

Or an org.

Or a group.

Now if you come from a traditional background.

Customers are created as organizations.

What are customers?

Google is a customer.

Facebook is a customer.

GE is a customer.

Right.

Siva is not a person.

Siva is not a customer.

He might be a contact person at most.

Or he might be an employee who might be a vendor.

But this is looking at ERP from a B2B perspective.

What about B2C?

Imagine using SAP in the banking sector.

Especially retail banking or real estate.

There.

Who is your customer?

A bank could be your customer if you are in real estate or vendor.

A borrower or lender could be customers or vendors for bank.

A guarantor which could be a bank or somebody else could be either a customer or a vendor.

The traditional definition of customer and vendor in the B2B world no longer holds good when you only

look at customer or vendor as an organization.

It could be a person.

It could be a group.

Traditionally in B2B, an org represents a company.

So this is a company.

But you don't always have to do business with a company, right?

How about a person?

For example.

From a supplying perspective.

A solo supplier.

Not a company.

I just supply some goods to you.

Right.

Or could be, from a consumer perspective, a B2C consumer like a shopper on Amazon.com.

So what is the difference between a shopper and a suppliers and a company?

What is the difference between these two?

Lots of difference.

For example, this guy does not have a VAT registration number.

Right.

On the other hand, a company is not defined as either male or female.

Or a company doesn't have a nationality.

A company doesn't have marital status like how a person would.

Right.

There is a third category called group.

Which represents a group of people.

For example, businesses could be done with a syndicate.

The syndicate is a group of people doing business.

That's it.

Or the purchasing group.

A group of people coming together to do purchasing transactions with you or sales transactions with

you.

That could be a group.

Most of the time you use person or org.

You use person, especially in the new dimension transactions like banking, real estate.

You use org in the traditional B2B transactions.

So this concept basically comes from CRM and those new generation modules.

Right.

So, for example, marital status can be configured behind the scenes to have married, divorced, whatever

different options that you have.

Right.

Same thing with occupation, Same thing with nationality.

You want to see where these are configured?

Let's go.

Let's see where they are configured.

So this is business partner grouping.

We're done with that and then we're done with number ranges.

Next go to persons.

And here we can define marital status.

We have single, married, widowed, divorced, separated.

If you have more statuses, you can put them here.

And then we have occupations, maintain different occupations.

Engineer, electrician.

Driver.

Doctor.

Whatever.

Right.

So this is configuration field specific for persons and for groups.

You can go to groups and define group types.

What kind of group is it?

Is it a syndicate group?

Is it a purchasing group?

Is it a sales group?

So on and so forth.

And for organizations, you can maintain the different industry sectors that that company is from or

what kind of legal entity is it?

Things that are relevant only for a B2B oriented business organization.

So.

Most of the time between persons, group and organizations.

In a B2B realm, you don't have to really worry.

It's always organization, never person or group.

But like I said.

You want to do some B to C relevant configuration then person.

Some groups come in.
