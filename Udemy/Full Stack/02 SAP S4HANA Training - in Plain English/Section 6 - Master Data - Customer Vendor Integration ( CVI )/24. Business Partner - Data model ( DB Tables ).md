# Business Partner - Data Model (DB Tables) in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section explores the data model behind the Business Partner (BP) concept in SAP S/4HANA, highlighting the similarities and differences between BP and traditional customer/vendor master data.

## Traditional Master Data
### Customer Master Data
- **General Data**: Stored in table KNA1
- **Finance Data**: Stored in table KNB1
- **Sales Data**: Stored in table KNVV

### Vendor Master Data
- **General Data**: Stored in table LFA1
- **Finance Data**: Stored in table LFB1
- **Purchasing Data**: Stored in table LFM1

## Business Partner Concept
### Definition
- **Business Partner (BP)**: A shell around customer and vendor data, integrating them into a unified framework.

### Transition to SAP S/4HANA
- **Mandatory Use**: BP is mandatory in SAP S/4HANA.
- **Deprecated Transactions**: Traditional transaction codes (e.g., VD01, XK01) are no longer used.

### Compatibility
- **Existing Data**: Data is either stored in traditional tables or new views are created to simulate old data structures.
- **New Table**: BUT000 stores general data for business partners.

## Practical Example
### Creating a Business Partner
1. **Transaction Code**: BP
2. **Create Organization**: Select BP category as "Organization."
3. **Enter Basic Information**:
   - Name: Bank of America
   - Address: Some Street, Some City, Some Country
4. **Save**: Business partner number (e.g., 63) is created.

### Extending to Vendor
1. **Change Mode**: Click on the change button to enable editing.
2. **Add Role**: FLVN00 (Finance View)
   - Enter Company Code: US09
   - Enter mandatory data: Reconciliation account, etc.
3. **Save**: Vendor number (e.g., 100013) is created, and data is stored in LFB1.

### Extending to Purchasing View
1. **Add Role**: FLVN01 (Purchasing View)
   - Enter Purchasing Organization: US09
   - Enter mandatory data: Currency, etc.
2. **Save**: Data is stored in LFM1.

## Data Storage
### General Data
- **Table**: BUT000
- **Example**: General data for BP number 63 (Bank of America) is stored in BUT000.

### Vendor Data
- **Finance Data**: Stored in LFB1
- **Purchasing Data**: Stored in LFM1

### Customer Data
- **Finance Data**: Stored in KNB1
- **Sales Data**: Stored in KNVV

## Conclusion
### Summary
- **Business Partner**: Acts as a shell, integrating customer and vendor data.
- **Data Storage**: General data is stored in BUT000, while specific roles (customer/vendor) store data in traditional tables.
- **Unified Approach**: BP transaction is used to create and manage business partners, replacing traditional transaction codes.

### Next Steps
- **Hands-On Examples**: Future chapters will provide more hands-on examples of creating and managing business partners in SAP S/4HANA.
- **Number Management**: Explore how BP numbers and customer/vendor numbers are managed and synchronized.


What have we seen so far?

We have seen what is a business partner.

We have created business partners.

And we have extended business partners with roles to create them either as vendor or as customer.

Now, let's go a little bit behind the scenes.

And see if there is any similarity between business partner and customer master and how the data is

structured behind the scenes.

As we know.

The customer master and the vendor master had three views.

Right.

General Sales.

Finance.

General Sales.

Finance.

Where is this data stored?

For customer master.

Key in one table stored the general data.

K and one.

K and B1 stores the company or finance data.

K and V stores the sales data.

This is for the customer.

If you take the vendor lf one stores the general data.

B1 stores, the company code data and M1 stores the purchasing data.

Okay.

So remember, I said BP is a shell.

A shell around customer and vendor.

As it exists today.

Now, this is a little hard to understand.

So when does this transition to S four Hana and says BP is a mandatory function.

So BP is a mandatory function.

You can't use this old customer master material, master transactions.

Here.

You should have one big question.

What will happen to all the existing data.

What will happen to all the existing customer masters material?

Masters.

Vendor Masters.

Well, material is not a big deal.

Customer and vendor.

And what happens to the data that's stored in these tables?

That's accessed by programs, existing programs.

That's thousands and thousands of lines of code.

Millions, rather.

So what happens to these programs?

Will these fail?

Should these fail?

Well, the goal of S four Hana is not to fail programs.

It's to build a bridge to a more simplified world.

Means meaning compatibility is a major criteria.

So everything that works in the old world should now work in the new world as well.

As for Hana.

That means data should either be stored in these tables or new views should be created so that data

can be stored in these tables.

So the way BP is being designed is.

There is a new table called Bet 000.

These are zeros as opposed to O's.

So anytime a new business partner is created, data gets created here.

But 000.

Okay.

This is the table.

Just like anyone.

This basically represents the data.

Either in the customer or the vendor.

That's the general data.

So when you create a.

This is what happens behind the scenes.

The general data gets stored here in but 000.

And now when you extend it as a customer, then data will also get stored here.

Okay.

And when you extend it as a vendor, data will also get stored here and you give it a sales or purchasing

rules.

Data will also get stored here and here.

Let's take an example.

So as soon as you enter BP, the last created customer will be available for you or last created business

partner.

If you want to create a new org, let's go create a new or click on new organization.

And we're not giving it any role yet.

Just the general role, 0000.

And we want to create, say, Bank of America.

Bank.

Of.

America.

Okay, some street and we give it some address.

Language is n.

And see.

Well, a business partner will be created for you.

With some number.

63.

64.

So 63 is our new business partner.

Now I want to open another window.

Now go to C 16.

Go to table, but 000, but 000.

I know.

It's a funny name.

So what's our partner?

I think it's 63.

And hit.

Execute.

So that's our customer for Bank of America or business partner for Bank of America.

It's not a customer yet.

It's a business partner.

So we have created a shell business partner with some address.

We double click that.

There you go.

That's Bank of America.

Right.

And then there are some other details that we'll go into later, like business partner type grouping

and so on and so forth.

No.

63 if you go inside.

K in a one.

63.

Does not exist, right?

If you go to vendor master for one that doesn't exist either.

Now what we're going to do is going to change mode and extend Bank of America as a business partner

to be a vendor.

Okay, so how do you do that?

Phlvvn zero zero, isn't it?

Scroll down.

Go down to.

This is vendor, right?

Phlvvn zero zero.

And I said, That's the finance view of the vendor Phlvvn zero zero.

Now automatically your company code comes up here, so click on company code.

And then enter the company code is zero nine or whatever company code you have created.

Okay, Enter the recon account and hit save.

Okay.

Now it says changes have been saved.

63 is our new vendor for Bank of America.

Now let's go back to 16.

And there will be not much of a change in but 000 anyway.

But what I want to show you is.

If you go to LFA one.

And put in vendor number 63.

Hit.

Execute.

You still don't see results, right?

Well, let's go back to our business partner, 63.

What's the vendor number here?

Do you see that?

100013.

This is the vendor number.

Now, this is a new vendor number.

It's created today.

Let me show that to you.

100013.

Enter that and hit.

Okay.

You see that?

Bank of America.

And it's the same address.

And it's created today.

12 for 2017.

What's the point?

When we created Bank of America as a business partner in BP.

The number that was created is 63.

And that was stored.

In this table.

Okay.

No entries were made either in any of these tables.

LFA 1KKN1K1.

None of these entries exist.

This was the first step.

And in the second step, we give this business partner a role of a vendor.

F l v.

N00.

Which basically extended this customer.

To the finance or company code view.

So we have entered company code data for.

Company code zero nine and automatically.

A new vendor number for this was created as.

100013.

100013.

As soon as that was created.

Let me change the color here.

Automatically an entry was made in this table.

So when you give the business partner a role of vendor.

This data is filled in.

Now this is equivalent to using the vendor master create transaction.

So what is the point Again, when you create a business partner?

You are neither creating a vendor nor creating a customer.

You're just creating a shell.

As you keep adding roles, the role of vendor purchasing view, which we are going to do next.

These tables that we know of will keep getting filled.

So like I said, let me do the third step, which is.

Extending the same business partner.

With the purchasing view.

What's the role for that?

And zero one.

So we are saved this.

And then we want to give it Phlvvn zero one, which is the purchasing view, right?

And in order to give it a purchasing view, what do you have to do?

Go to purchasing.

Give the purchase order that you are extending this business partner to.

And.

USD, right?

It's not created yet.

So 100013 should now be created after I save it.

In which table?

Lf m one Right now I have not saved it yet.

That means an entry should not exist for that vendor in one, isn't it?

So let's take this vendor number 1000013.

Instead of LFA one, which is the general data table.

Let's go to Lf one which is supposed to be the purchasing table.

Go back all the way.

LFM1.

Select the vendor number.

Put the vendor number in there and hit.

Execute.

No entries have been found.

That's because we have not saved that business partners role yet.

So you go here and in the new role that we are extending this vendor to, let's go save this guy.

So business partner, 63 has been saved and the vendor number should now exist in the purchasing view.

Right.

So let's go refresh that.

Execute and you have one entry there, isn't it?

And that was just created by me today just by extending that role.

See, we gave it a currency of USD and then that's all we did.

We didn't put much else in there.

So this.

Let me change the color.

So when you give this role, it's the same vendor.

But data has been extended.

For this table.

Now, the same would apply if I were creating a customer from that.

So if I created Bank of America as a customer, the number would still remain the same.

63 but I would give it what role?

If.

Q00.

Right.

That's the basic and company code view.

So as soon as I do that.

These tables will be filled up.

And then step number two, I give it another roll.

FQ01.

Which will give it a sales view.

And a key difference here is that this number and this vendor number are different.

Same thing when you create it as a customer.

This BP, which is 63, would be different from this number.

This number could be something else you don't know.

Say 1400, 1500 and this number would be different.

From this number.

Now how these numbers are different.

Why these numbers are different.

What to ensure that these numbers are the same or you can keep them different is something that we are

going to see in the next set of chapters.

Just understand that business partner is a shell and you're going to extend that business partner with

roles to create either a customer or a vendor.

Different views, different roles.

And when you do that, two things could happen.

It could either be created with the same number or with a different number.

And as soon as those roles are extended, the corresponding tables for customer, master or vendor master

are filled up.

So the data.

Corresponding to the role of a vendor or customer is not stored in this, but zero zero table.

It stored in the old tables k one, K and B1K in core customer and LFA one lf B-1 and Lf one for vendor.

Now, these are not the only tables.

There are tax tables.

There are VAT registration tables, many different tables for either customer or vendor.

I'm just taking these three tables so that you can easily understand.
