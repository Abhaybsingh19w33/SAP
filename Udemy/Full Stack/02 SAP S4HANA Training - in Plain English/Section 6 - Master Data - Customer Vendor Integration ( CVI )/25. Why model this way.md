# Why Model This Way in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section addresses the rationale behind SAP's transition to the Business Partner (BP) model in SAP S/4HANA and the complexities involved in this process.

## The Need for Change
### Existing Customer and Vendor Master Structures
- **Redundant Models**: The traditional customer and vendor master data structures are outdated and redundant.
- **Complexity**: These models are not simpler and lead to issues such as address duplication.
- **Compatibility**: The primary reason for the complexity is to maintain compatibility with existing systems and ensure that existing code continues to run seamlessly.

## The Business Partner Approach
### Unified Entity
- **Business Partner (BP)**: Combines customer and vendor data into a single framework.
- **Data Storage**: While data is still stored in traditional customer and vendor master tables, the BP model provides a more streamlined and efficient way to manage this information.

### Integration with Other Modules
- **Better Integration**: The BP model enhances integration with other SAP modules and satellite systems such as:
  - CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
  - SRM (Supplier Relationship Management)
  - Financial Supply Chain Management
  - Treasury Management

### Central Management
- **Single Point of Entry**: Instead of using multiple transaction codes for different tasks related to customers and vendors, users can manage all business partner data through a single transaction code, BP.
- **Elimination of Multiple Transaction Codes**: Simplifies the process by eliminating the need for approximately 20 different transaction codes associated with customer and vendor management.

## Compatibility and Data Storage
### Roundabout Method
- **Dual Storage**: Data is stored in both the new BP tables and the old customer and vendor tables to ensure compatibility with existing code.
- **Table Mapping**:
  - **Customer Data**:
    - KNA1 (General Data) -> BUT000
    - KNB1 (Finance Data) remains the same
    - KNVV (Sales Data) remains the same
  - **Vendor Data**:
    - LFA1 (General Data) -> BUT000
    - LFB1 (Finance Data) remains the same
    - LFM1 (Purchasing Data) remains the same

## Conclusion
### Summary
- **Rationale**: The transition to the BP model is driven by the need to maintain compatibility with existing systems while providing a more efficient and integrated approach to data management.
- **Benefits**: Better integration with other modules, central management of business partner data, and elimination of redundant transaction codes.

### Next Steps
- **Configuration**: Future chapters will cover the configuration of business partners.
- **Data Migration**: Discussion on data migration from ECC to S/4HANA.



Now, you might have a question.

What are we trying to achieve with all this?

Why all this complication?

The big deal.

Is that?

The existing customer, master and vendor master structures.

Write the data models.

The redundant models.

Old style.

They are not simpler.

The reason why we are having to do all this complexity is because we want to retain the status quo.

If not for that, we don't have to fill these tables, but we want the existing code to run.

We want the existing code to run seamlessly.

That's why.

We are having to do all this roundabout hockey.

Hockey, if not, probably would have taken a different, much simpler route.

So this is a big deal.

This is a big change.

And SAP is going this way, the business partner route, because the existing customer, master and

vendor master or redundant data models.

Meaning there is address duplicacy happening there.

Both of them are numbers, just different views, just different set of data, isn't it?

So why create a whole new set of tables?

ASAP is trying to combine all of them into one entity called the business Partner.

But still storing the data in the customer master table and vendor master table because the existing

code should work.

Probably in the next set of releases somewhere down the line, this model might change.

So this is as of 1611.

And this also this model also results in better.

Integration.

With CRM because CRM uses business partner.

SRM uses business partner.

Financial supply chain management uses business partner.

Treasury uses business partner.

Wait, so this is better integration with the satellite systems and other modules.

Also this results in Central.

Management.

So single point of entry.

So you don't have to remember 30 different transaction codes.

I've given you only three for customer and three for vendor.

Right?

These are not the only ones to create a contact.

You have a transaction code Vp1.

And two for change.

Three for display.

So there are close to 20 different transaction codes associated with customer and vendor that have been

eliminated.

It's just single point of entry.

That is, BP and every partner can be managed right in BP.

And also.

The roundabout stuff for storing data in and one and all that is done so that.

Existing code.

Works fine.

And that is for compatibility.

So purely in terms of table mapping.

K one what happens to K one?

This goes to 000.

This remains in.

K and v v remains the same.

K one remains the same.

K one also remains the same, but a copy of it originates here.

Right.

Same thing with Vendor one.

He stored in batch 000.

Also, it starts here and moves here.

And lf b1.

Lf M1 stays the same.

Now, in the next set of chapters, we'll go through Configuration of business, partner.

And after that, we'll talk about data migration of business partners from ECC to S four Hana.
