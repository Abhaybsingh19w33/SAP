# What is Business Partner in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
One of the first topics in the Delta functionality for SAP S/4HANA, either in version 1511 or 1610, is Customer Vendor Integration, also known as Business Partner.

## Traditional Master Data
### Customer and Vendor Data
- **Customer Data**: Divided into three parts
  - General Data
  - Sales Data
  - Finance Data
- **Vendor Data**: Divided into three parts
  - General Data
  - Finance Data
  - Purchasing Data

### Traditional Transaction Codes
- **Customer**: VD01 (Create), VD02 (Change), VD03 (Display)
- **Vendor**: XK01 (Create), XK02 (Change), XK03 (Display)

## Business Partner Concept
### Definition
- **Business Partner (BP)**: A unified framework for managing all types of business partners, including customers, vendors, banks, and other entities.

### Need for Integration
- **New Dimensional Modules**: CRM, SRM, Treasury Management, Financial Supply Chain Management require a more integrated view of business partners.
- **Examples of Business Partners**: Lenders, brokers, tenants, landlords in a real estate agency.

### Implementation in SAP S/4HANA
- **Mandatory Use**: Business Partner concept is mandatory in SAP S/4HANA.
- **Unified Transaction Code**: BP (Create, Change, Display)

## Practical Demonstration
### Traditional SAP ERP System (ECC)
- **Customer Master**: VD03 (Display Customer)
- **Vendor Master**: XK03 (Display Vendor)
- **Business Partner**: BP (Create Business Partner)

### SAP S/4HANA System
- **Deprecated Transactions**: VD01, XK01 redirect to BP.
- **Unified Approach**: Use BP transaction to create and manage business partners.

## Conclusion
### Summary
- **Traditional Approach**: Separate transactions for customer and vendor master data.
- **Business Partner Concept**: Unified and mandatory in SAP S/4HANA.
- **Transition**: Deprecated traditional transactions in favor of the BP transaction.

### Next Steps
- **Hands-On**: Future chapters will provide hands-on examples of creating customers and vendors using the BP transaction in SAP S/4HANA.



One of the first topics in the Delta functionality, either in 15, 11 or in 1610.

Is something called as customer vendor integration.

It's also called business partner.

So what is this concept now as an XG consultant or or consultant?

In order.

Primarily, there are two pieces of master data.

One is a customer.

Another.

The vendor.

Right.

Well, there are assets and other stuff, But but from a logistics perspective, these are the two main

pieces of master data.

Customer.

And vendor.

No customer's data is divided into three parts.

Right.

So there is general data.

There is sales data.

And then there is finance data.

Same thing with the vendor.

Divided into three parts.

Uh, there is a general data.

There is a finance data.

And then there is purchasing data.

And finance.

The module.

Deals with accounts payable.

Via this vendor number, For example, vendor number 4100.

Say Walmart.

So all accounts payable for Walmart is dealt with this number.

The same.

Walmart could also be a customer, right?

Say Customer 80101.

Walmart and all the AR accounts receivable and other areas like credit management.

Dunning.

Will be dealt with from this customer numbers perspective.

Well, it has worked so far very well.

Everything is good.

Now, both of them are business partners, right?

Customer or vendor?

But these are not the only type of business partners.

A bank is an example of a business partner.

And especially in B2C, there are different kinds of business partners.

Think of a real estate agency.

Who is a business partner for them.

The lender is a business partner.

The broker is a business partner.

The tenant is a business partner.

The landlord is a business partner.

Right.

All of them might not need sales, data, purchasing, data finance, data.

They might need different set of data.

So new dimensional modules like CRM.

SRM.

Or Treasury management or financial supply chain management.

These modules need a more integrated view of all the business partners.

The old model for having one particular rigid model for customer and one particular rigid model for

vendor no longer holds good with these new dimensional modules.

So what SAP has done is created a shell.

Around this.

And gave it a general name called Business Partner.

No.

Like I said, this is not new.

And as for Hana.

This has been there in SAP even before S4 Hana.

The only difference is that in s four, Hana business partner has been made mandatory.

It's a prerequisite.

You want to check it?

All right.

This is not an S four Hana system.

This is an SEC system.

All right, Now I'm using the transaction zero three.

Right.

Customer Master View.

And then enter a customer, say 1400.

And here is your customer.

So an sec?

Customers exist.

Vendors exist.

So customers, whatever numbers and vendors, whatever numbers.

So this is customer.

This is vendor.

How do you view your customer or create your customer?

Either zero 1 or 0 1 or 0 one.

This is to create, of course, to change it, to use zero two and zero three change and display.

Vendor is XK01FK01 for financial view and MK01 for general and purchasing use.

This is the existing world of SAP.

Now, a little known fact for some of us is that there is something called as a business partner right

here in SEC.

You want to see it?

Let's go back and type in BP.

The transaction is BP.

Right.

Enter.

And we want to create an organization.

And we want to create a Facebook.

Okay.

That's your business partner.

And just click save.

So business partner 2071 has been created.

Right.

And this business partner can now be extended to a vendor and a customer.

So we'll talk more about this.

So apart from the customer, master and vendor master.

Another type of master data existed called BP.

Business partner.

And the transaction for that is BP.

That's it.

There is no change display.

Everything is there in that same transaction.

Now with S4 Hana.

BP still remains.

The transaction code is BP, But these things are gone.

You can no longer use zero one.

AFD01 or XK0.

These transactions are gone.

So what's the point?

The point is, SAP no longer wants us to use the old transactions to create customer, master and vendor

master.

Material master still remains, by the way, zero and one.

That still remains.

But vendors and customers, the transactions as they exist today are gone.

And this is one example of a mandatory change.

As Hana always has to use business partner.

No longer can you use the standard.

Vendor master Creator.

Customer.

Master create.

We want to check it.

Let's do it.

All right.

What is the transaction code for customer?

So this is our sap s four Hana system, right?

S four Hana.

Now, what is the transaction for customer Master VD01.

Right.

Look at what happens now.

Redirecting to BP as transaction zero one is obsolete.

All right.

We'll see more about later.

But all I just want to show you is that.

The transaction code to create a customer master as we know it.

010101 does not exist.

Same thing with vendor Try ZK zero one.

Vendor master create all views.

See redirecting to BP.

Right.

So this is one of the primary changes in master data with S four Hana.

In the next chapter, we'll do a hands on.

We'll create a customer.

We'll create a vendor in.
