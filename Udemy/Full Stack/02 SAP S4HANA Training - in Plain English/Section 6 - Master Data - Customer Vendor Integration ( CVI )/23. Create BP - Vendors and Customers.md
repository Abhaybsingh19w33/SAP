# Creating Business Partners (BP) in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section provides a hands-on guide for creating and managing Business Partners (BP) in SAP S/4HANA, including extending BPs to customers and vendors.

## Searching for Existing Customers
- **Transaction Code**: BP (Business Partner)
- **Search Criteria**: Name, search term, number, address, etc.
  - **Example**: Searching for "Walmart" displays all business partners with that name.

## Creating a New Business Partner
### Basic Steps
1. **Transaction Code**: BP
2. **Create Organization**: Select BP category as "Organization."
3. **Enter Basic Information**:
   - Name: G Aerospace
   - Search Term: G
   - Address: 1000 The Nice Drive, 08820, Edison, US
4. **Save**: Business partner number (e.g., 61) is created.

### Extending to Customer
1. **Change Mode**: Click on the change button to enable editing.
2. **Add Role**: FLCU01 (Sales View)
   - Enter Sales Area: US09, 01, 01
   - Enter mandatory data: Sales district, shipping conditions, etc.
3. **Add Role**: FLCU00 (Finance View)
   - Enter Company Code: US09
   - Enter mandatory data: Reconciliation account, etc.
4. **Save**: Changes are saved, and the business partner is now extended to a customer.

### Extending to Vendor
1. **Create New BP**: Follow the same steps to create a new BP for "Target Inc."
2. **Add Role**: FLVN00 (Finance View)
   - Enter Company Code: US09
   - Enter mandatory data: Reconciliation account, etc.
3. **Add Role**: FLVN01 (Purchasing View)
   - Enter Purchasing Organization: US09
   - Enter mandatory data: Currency, etc.
4. **Save**: Changes are saved, and the business partner is now extended to a vendor.

## Practical Demonstration
### Traditional SAP ERP System (ECC)
- **Customer Master**: VD03 (Display Customer)
- **Vendor Master**: XK03 (Display Vendor)
- **Business Partner**: BP (Create Business Partner)

### SAP S/4HANA System
- **Deprecated Transactions**: VD01, XK01 redirect to BP.
- **Unified Approach**: Use BP transaction to create and manage business partners.

## Conclusion
### Summary
- **Traditional Approach**: Separate transactions for customer and vendor master data.
- **Business Partner Concept**: Unified and mandatory in SAP S/4HANA.
- **Transition**: Deprecated traditional transactions in favor of the BP transaction.

### Next Steps
- **Hands-On**: Future chapters will provide hands-on examples of creating customers and vendors using the BP transaction in SAP S/4HANA.








Let's do a quick hands on with BP.

So transaction code is easy, right?

BP business partner.

And over here, you can search for existing customers.

So, for example, you can search for existing customers, like just type in Walmart and click Start.

So it will search for all customers with the name Walmart.

And it has found two business partners and both those business partners are listed here, partner number

11 and 12.

You can search by name, you can search by search term, you can search by number, you can search by

address.

So many different criteria.

Now let's create a new customer.

All right.

Now, don't try and understand all of this stuff right now.

Take some time.

So we'll go step by step.

There are three ways in which you can create a customer.

Or rather business partner.

For now, we are not creating a customer yet.

We are creating a business partner first.

Remember business partner is that shell where the basic data like address and stuff like that exist?

And when you want to create a customer, you extend that business partner to create a customer.

We'll see an example of that.

Say we want to create an organization.

This is called BP category.

There are three categories, and this is hard coded person.

Org group.

We'll talk more about that later, for example.

Let's just now create an organization.

What organization do we want to create?

Say G.

It says choose the role.

Okay.

I'll choose the role later.

For now, let it remain as 00000 and type in.

G.

Aerospace.

Right And the search term is a.

G.

And the address is a 1000.

The nice dry.

And 08820.

That's the zip code.

Edison.

Us.

And oops.

Us.

Right.

And anything else that you want to enter, you can enter.

If not, you can just click Save.

Just with the basic data, we should be able to create a business partner for you.

61.

So 61 is our business partner.

Oh 61.

Business partner.

Can now be extended to create, say, a customer on the same business partner can be extended to create

a vendor also.

How do you do that?

Well, now 61 is there and it's in display mode.

Right.

You can't change anything.

It's all grayed out.

Go click on the change button.

All the fields open up.

Now you got to add a roll.

The role to be added to create a customer master.

E's FLCU01 and zero zero.

For example, let's just say FLQ01.

This gives us.

A new set of buttons.

Here we see that this was not there before.

You can just rewind the video if you want.

This role is extending the business partner to a sales view.

Now, if you go to sales and distribution, click on this button.

I've already created some sales area.

US zero nine.

Zero one.

Zero one.

Enter.

And you can enter the rest of the data like sales district.

Everything that is mandatory has to be entered, right?

So enter sales district.

And enter a prize group.

What else is missing?

Shipping.

I think you need to enter the shipping conditions.

Right.

Let's not enter it for now and just see what happens and do billing.

Put a tax.

Jurisdiction here.

And partner functions.

Let's pick what is there by default.

We don't care.

Save it.

Area.

General data contains errors.

Now, the difference that I wanted to point out here is with Customer Master zero 1 or 0 one.

Every tab.

That you enter data in has to be complete, right?

You can't go to the next data if you hit enter.

But business partner is a little smart.

It marks the corresponding tab with a red dot.

That means that something is missing.

But you can still move on to the next tab, you see.

The red dot indicates that there is an error in that.

So let's go fill that error.

All right.

Uh, the language is in.

Okay.

The red dot should be gone.

Let's see what else is missing.

Save it.

Now, how about the finance view?

The finance view is available in.

This rule.

FLQ00.

Okay.

Now you see, the company code tab has opened up, right?

So click on the company code tab.

And what's the company code?

I've created a company code US zero nine.

Select that.

Enter.

And then you can pick up a recon account and any other data that is necessary for the customer master.

Say.

Customer receivables domestic.

Enter.

And save.

Changes have been saved.

All right.

So.

So what have we done just now?

We have created a business partner.

Using the transaction.

BP.

And extended it to create a customer and to extend that, we have used two views or roles.

If LCU zero zero.

If LCU zero one.

This role extended the BP to create the finance data or the company code data.

This role extended the BP to create the sales views.

Now, can you do the same with a vendor?

Let's create a new.

And extend it as a vendor, right?

This time we're going to create a new BP and extend it to a vendor and we'll see what are the roles

that are required to extend the BP to a vendor?

All right.

What's the transaction?

Beep again.

Which vendor shall we create?

Let's say, create a vendor for Target.

Okay, So new organization.

Click.

Okay.

And we're going to create Target.

Inc.

And the search term is target and you can put some street address, say 2000.

08820.

Edison.

Us.

New Jersey.

And then you can put in some phone numbers, fax numbers, email, so on.

Right.

Save this guy.

So we have created Target as a business partner.

That's it.

It's neither a customer nor a vendor yet.

Number 62.

Now we can go to change and give it a roll.

Of f l v.

N00.

All right.

Now, company code.

Select that.

And which company code say was zero nine.

Right.

And then some recon account because that's all we need in the company code view.

Trade payables, domestic say he is a domestic customer.

And then if you want to enter any other data, just go ahead and enter and just observe.

This field vendor is internal and then save.

So it says area general data contains errors.

So what's the error?

The error probably is with the language.

Right.

So go there.

Enter English.

And.

Company code data.

Us.

Zero nine.

Your recon account is entered.

Click Save again.

Changes have been saved.

62.

Business partner is now a vendor with a company called Data Extended.

But what is the other view that the vendor has?

Purchasing view, Right.

So go to purchasing.

Select Phlvvn.

Zero one.

That's the rule for creating the purchasing view of the vendor.

All right, so what is the purchase?

Org.

I've created a purchase.

Org.

Zero nine.

Right now, you can enter the data that is relevant for purchasing like currency, any other purchasing

data that you should enter.

And click save changes have been saved.

Now if you go back to display mode.

And then see the dropdowns here.

It will only list the dropdowns that have been maintained, meaning the roles that have been maintained.

Right, general partner.

Don't worry about the financial services.

General partner, vendor, company code, Vendor purchasing view.

So what have we done here?

We have created a VP number 62.

And made it a vendor by giving it two rolls.

FLVN00.

This gave it the finance view or company code view.

And then if LVN01.

This gave it the purchasing view.

So far, so good, right?

We have created a business partner, extended it to create customers, and for that we have used two

roles FX00 and FX01.

Same thing with the vendor.

We have started with a blank business partner and then made it a vendor by giving it two roles Phlvvn

zero zero Phlvvn zero one.

In the Hannah world.

This is the only way to create customers and vendors.

You cannot use the standard old codes.

Now, in the next chapter, we'll see some examples of how really is different from the customer, master

and vendor master and what kind of tables are used behind the scenes, so on and so forth.
