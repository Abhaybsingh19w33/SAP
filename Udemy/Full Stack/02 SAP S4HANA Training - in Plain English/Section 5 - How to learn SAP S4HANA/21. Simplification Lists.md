# Simplification Lists in SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
This section explains how to learn SAP S/4HANA by focusing on the concept of Delta functionality and using the simplification lists provided by SAP.

## Learning Approach
### Existing Functionality
- **Core Modules**: SD, MM, FI, etc.
- **Unchanged Processes**: Approximately 90% of the functionality and configuration remain the same.
  - **Example**: SD consultants still manage document types, item categories, pricing, etc.

### Delta Functionality
- **Definition**: Changes or new features introduced in SAP S/4HANA.
- **Focus**: Identify and learn the Delta functionality specific to each version.

## Simplification Lists
### Purpose
- **Document**: Lists all Delta functionality by functional area.
- **Format**: Available as a PDF document for each version of SAP S/4HANA.

### How to Use
- **Search**: Google "1511 SAP S/4HANA simplification list" or "1610 SAP S/4HANA simplification list."
- **Content**: Contains changes in master data, functional areas, and specific processes.

### Example Content
- **Master Data**: Changes in Customer Master, Material Master, etc.
- **Functional Areas**: Changes in rebate processing, credit management, revenue recognition, etc.

## Optional vs. Mandatory Functionality
### Optional Functionality
- **Example**: New output determination technique based on BRF+.
- **Adoption**: Can be adopted at any time.

### Mandatory Functionality
- **Example**: Replacement of Customer and Vendor Masters with the Business Partner concept.
- **Requirement**: Must be implemented for a successful S/4HANA upgrade.

## Conclusion
### Summary
- **Existing Functionality**: 90% remains the same.
- **Delta Functionality**: Focus on the 10% that has changed.
- **Simplification Lists**: Key resource for identifying changes.

### Next Steps
- **Explore Changes**: Future chapters will discuss optional and mandatory changes in detail.
- **Implementation**: Understand and implement mandatory changes for successful S/4HANA adoption.

## Next Steps
- **Simplification Lists**: Further discussions on simplification lists.
- **Delta Functionality**: Exploration of Delta functionality as the evolution of SAP S/4HANA progresses.



Now that we understand the basics of S four Hana.

The next thing to understand is how do you learn a foreign.

The way you learn is for Hannah is not like learning SDR or SRM or CRM.

You don't have a lot to learn in s four Hana.

And if you are not already a functional consultant.

Say as the mpfi.

You can't learn SAP.

As for Hana directly.

Why is that?

Well with s four Hana.

There is a little bit of new functionality that's being added.

But the rest of the functionality remains the same.

This is something that we have to understand existing functionality.

Remains.

For the most part.

Meaning?

An ASD consultant would still get to do document types, item categories, schedule lines, copy controls

and all the stuff that he's used to.

And consultant still gets to do purchase document types.

Item categories, pricing, invoice receipts, invoice verification, all the stuff that he's used to.

So existing functionality remains the same for the most part.

Let me put a disclaimer here.

90%.

Okay.

Second thing.

Existing configuration remains again.

Let me put a disclaimer here.

90%.

This applies to most of the functionality.

SD MPP Any core module that you take, if you ask me the reason why.

Think of it like this.

The business processes have not changed.

Isn't it?

As a functional consultant, you are worried about the business processes.

Your role is to model the business process in that particular company.

Say you're working for GE Aerospace.

You're supposed to be modeling their business processes in SAP.

And irrespective of s four Hana or not, the business will not change, isn't it?

The business remains the same.

As Verena just gives a sap the ERP a new dimension.

Now, you might have a question here.

The existing functionality remains the same.

Existing configuration remains the same.

So what is there to learn in S four Hana?

Quite frankly, not a lot.

You see, 90% remains the same, right?

So 10% of the functionality has to be learned and 10% of the config has to be learned.

Now, this is as of.

1610.

And the same applies for 1511 version as well.

Remember, 1511 is released in 2015 and 1610 is released in the November of 2016.

This is the first version of logistics.

This is the second version of simple logistics.

And then as versions progress.

You'll have slight differences in functionality.

That is for sure.

So the keyword that SAP uses for this is called Delta functionality.

What is Delta functionality?

What is Delta?

Delta means a change, right?

So the way to learn SAP, as for Hana is through Delta functionality.

Identify the change in the functionality or configuration and then learn just that.

Now how do you identify what is the Delta functionality in SD?

What is the delta functionality in.

So on.

And so how do you know?

What are the changes?

The way to learn this SAP releases something called as simplification list.

And this is done with every version.

Just go Google, say 1511.

SAP s four Hana simplification list or 1610 sap s four Hana Simplification list.

If you google that.

ASAP comes up with a PDF and that pdf contains.

All Delta functionality available in that version.

Think of it like release notes.

Release notes for that particular version.

Now.

Now, remember, simplification list for 1610.

Is close to 400 pages.

I don't want to go through all of that at this point.

You know, there is a whole bunch of stuff in there.

What it essentially contains is Delta functionality by functional area.

So delta functionality.

By.

Functional area.

Meaning is the.

These are the changes.

Mhm.

These are the changes.

Master data, so on and so forth.

All the changes in all the modules are listed in this document.

So this document will be your guide.

So here is how the document will look like.

It starts with.

The master data.

So that has all the necessary changes in master data.

Customer Master Material Master.

What are the impacts of this on the different subsystems?

Like what is the impact of Material Master on SRM Product Master?

What is the impact of business partner on CRM?

What new material types are being released.

And then it goes on to the respective function areas.

So what are the changes?

So it talks about rebate processing replaced by settlement management, complaint handling, simplified

data models of what happens to foreign trade, what happens to credit management, what happens to revenue

recognition.

You get the point.

Right now we understand that.

We start with the Delta functionality to understand what you need to learn in a particular version.

All right.

No.

Now, do you have to worry about everything in that simplification list?

Well, the consultant will look at his respective area.

The consultant will look at his respective area.

The consultant or consultant will look at his respective area.

But not all changes are mandatory.

For example, in SD.

Output determination has changed.

It's no longer based on the standard condition technique that we know of.

It's based on a technique called Braf plus business rules framework.

So that's optional.

You don't have to use it.

ASAP, throws it out there and it's an advanced technique and you can choose to use it.

You don't want to use it, you don't need to use it.

You can use the standard SAP output functionality.

So in terms of the Delta functionality.

There is optional functionality and then there is something called as mandatory functionality.

For example, business partner.

In SD.

We no longer use the standard customer master.

In Amman.

We no longer use the standard vendor master that we know of.

There have been replaced with a more generic concept, which will be the topic of our next section called

Business Partner.

And this is mandatory.

You can't say, I don't want to use business partner.

I'll use customer master or vendor master.

So there is optional functionality and there is mandatory functionality.

You don't have to use everything that is optional.

You can use it at any point of time after you upgrade to for Hana and all the mandatory functionality

has to be implemented.

That's a rule.

Without that, sap s four Hana upgrade will fail.

Right.

So let's summarize what we have just learned with S four Hana.

There's going to be a change in functionality, but that's not a lot.

Most of the functionality will remain the same.

The examples we have talked about some examples, some examples in SD, some examples in.

And then we discussed about Delta functionality.

So this is the 10% change.

That's represented as Delta functionality.

Delta meaning difference between the old and the new.

10% is an approximation.

It's not always 10% in SD.

Not always.

10% in not always.

10% in the percentage would change.

I'm just giving an approximation here.

Say 10%.

Not more than that.

So how do you know with each version, say 15, 11, 16, ten?

What is the functionality that has changed?

The SAP releases what's called as a simplification list.

You can just go Google it.

1511 SAP s four Hana simplification list and you'll get a PDF.

We have seen an example of a PDF.

And that basically lists all the Delta functionality by functional area.

So in SD, these are the changes in these are the changes.

Now, all changes are not mandatory.

Most of the changes are optional.

90% of the changes are optional.

Some of the changes are mandatory.

We have discussed examples of each of them.

And going forward, that is what we'll be discussing, these optional changes and mandatory changes.

What is a mandatory change?

When you want to use s four Hana either as a migration from an existing EC instance or as a greenfield

new SAP, for instance, all mandatory changes have to be implemented.

Optional changes need not be.

You can implement them anytime in the future, whenever you are ready.

In general, this is how you learn.

As for now, from the next set of chapters, we'll explore each topic section by section.
