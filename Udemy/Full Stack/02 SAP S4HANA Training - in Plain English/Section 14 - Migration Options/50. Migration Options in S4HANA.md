# Migration Options in S/4HANA

## Introduction
The provided text discusses the different migration options available for implementing SAP S/4HANA. There are three primary types of implementations: Greenfield, Brownfield, and Landscape Transformation.

## Types of Implementations

### 1. Greenfield Implementation
A Greenfield implementation is akin to a new SAP implementation, where the migration is from a non-SAP legacy system directly to SAP S/4HANA. This type of implementation does not involve any existing SAP ECC system and is essentially starting from scratch with a fresh setup.

### 2. Brownfield Implementation
A Brownfield implementation involves migrating from an existing SAP ECC system to SAP S/4HANA. This can also include a mix of legacy non-SAP systems and SAP ECC systems. The key aspect of a Brownfield implementation is that it leverages the existing SAP infrastructure and data, making it more of an upgrade rather than a completely new setup.

### 3. Landscape Transformation
Landscape Transformation involves consolidating multiple systems, such as CRM, SCM, and other SAP or non-SAP systems, into a single SAP S/4HANA instance. Landscape Transformation is unique to HANA and S/4HANA due to the database's ability to handle large volumes of data with high performance and compression capabilities. This consolidation reduces the overall data footprint and improves system performance.

#### Types of Landscape Transformation
- **Consolidation**: Merging multiple separate instances into a single instance with different clients for each module. This is possible due to the significant data compression and performance improvements offered by the HANA database.

## Roles and Responsibilities of Functional Consultants

### Greenfield Implementation
- Extensive testing and validation are required as it is a completely new setup.

### Brownfield Implementation
- Focus on migration and regression testing to ensure the existing processes work correctly in the new system.

### Landscape Transformation
- Primarily involves regression testing and ensuring that the consolidated system functions correctly.

## Summary of Migration Options

### Greenfield
- **Description**: Starting from scratch with a new implementation.
- **Methodology**: Standard ASAP or Activate methodology.
- **Testing**: Extensive testing and validation.

### Brownfield
- **Description**: Migrating from ECC to S/4HANA or a mix of legacy and ECC systems.
- **Methodology**: Activate methodology or ASAP.
- **Testing**: Migration and regression testing.

### Landscape Transformation
- **Description**: Consolidating multiple systems into one instance.
- **Methodology**: Basis migration, minimal data migration if consolidating databases.
- **Testing**: Regression testing, post-processing, and validation as needed.

## Conclusion
Each migration option has its own set of requirements and roles for functional consultants. Understanding the specific needs and processes involved in each type of implementation is crucial for a successful SAP S/4HANA migration.

The provided text discusses the different migration options available for implementing SAP S/4HANA. There are three primary types of implementations: Greenfield, Brownfield, and Landscape Transformation.

A Greenfield implementation is akin to a new SAP implementation, where the migration is from a non-SAP legacy system directly to SAP S/4HANA. This type of implementation does not involve any existing SAP ECC system and is essentially starting from scratch with a fresh setup.

A Brownfield implementation involves migrating from an existing SAP ECC system to SAP S/4HANA. This can also include a mix of legacy non-SAP systems and SAP ECC systems. The key aspect of a Brownfield implementation is that it leverages the existing SAP infrastructure and data, making it more of an upgrade rather than a completely new setup.

The third type of implementation is Landscape Transformation. This involves consolidating multiple systems, such as CRM, SCM, and other SAP or non-SAP systems, into a single SAP S/4HANA instance. Landscape Transformation is unique to HANA and S/4HANA due to the database's ability to handle large volumes of data with high performance and compression capabilities. This consolidation reduces the overall data footprint and improves system performance.

The text further explains that there are two kinds of landscape transformations: consolidation and another unspecified type. Consolidation involves merging multiple separate instances into a single instance with different clients for each module. This is possible due to the significant data compression and performance improvements offered by the HANA database.

For each migration option, the text outlines the roles and responsibilities of functional consultants. In a Greenfield implementation, extensive testing and validation are required as it is a completely new setup. In a Brownfield implementation, the focus is on migration and regression testing to ensure the existing processes work correctly in the new system. Landscape Transformation primarily involves regression testing and ensuring that the consolidated system functions correctly.

The text concludes by summarizing the three types of migration options and their respective methodologies. Greenfield involves starting from scratch, Brownfield is an upgrade from ECC to S/4HANA, and Landscape Transformation consolidates multiple systems into one. Each option has its own set of requirements and roles for functional consultants, emphasizing the importance of understanding the specific needs and processes involved in each type of implementation.



In this section, we'll talk about the migration options.

Or implementation options.

There are three kinds of implementations in s four Hana.

The first is called greenfield implementation.

This is just like a new SAP implementation, either in SEC or it doesn't matter.

So from a legacy system.

You're going to move to sap s four Hana.

What is the legacy system here?

This is a non SAP system.

Any non SAP system.

This is called as a greenfield implementation.

So directly from a non-sap system, you're going to move to S four Hana.

So there is no SEC in between.

Write directly to S four Hana.

The second option is called as a brownfield implementation.

What is a brownfield implementation?

It could be a mix.

Typically, you know, there is an SAP system, one or more.

There could be legacy systems as well.

Non-sap right mix or just scpc.

So if you are migrating purely from a non SAP ERP or there need not be an ERP, it could be a fresh

implementation in cases like that.

It's called a greenfield.

And in cases where you migrate from ECC to Hana or a mix of legacy and ECC to S for Hana, this is called

as a brownfield implementation.

The third kind of implementation or migration is called.

Landscape transformation.

What is a landscape transformation?

Landscape transformation is where you have a bunch of systems like CRM.

CRM.

And they'll be consolidated typically into AS4 Hana.

System.

Before I talk more about the migration options, this landscape transformation is something that's very

unique to Hana, not just as for Hana.

What do I mean by that?

Let me explain that before we go talk about the migration options.

There are two kinds of landscape transformations that can happen.

So what is a landscape transformation?

The first kind of landscape transformation is called consolidation.

And this is probably the simpler of the landscape transformations.

How is this done?

Like I said, we could have a CRM system.

We could have an XY system.

We have an asylum system.

System, So on and so forth.

Right.

And they're all linked together.

Right.

So this is.

They are linked in that landscape.

So what do I mean by consolidation?

So from this kind of a landscape, you move to a single instance.

So these are all separate instances, right?

These are separate instances.

From this kind of landscape, you consolidate to a single instance.

It's just one instance.

Where you have CRM.

SEC.

In Salem.

Gets.

Or any combination.

You don't have to combine all of them.

You can combine some and leave others.

And these are clients.

Like client 100, CRM 200 is SEC.

300 is CRM.

400 is.

What is the advantage of doing it?

Why?

Why are we doing it?

The only reason why this can be done.

Is because.

For example, CRM in a non Hana database.

Right.

The non Hana database.

CRM is a 100 GB.

X 300 GB.

This item is 100 GB.

GHS is 100 GB, right?

These are the sizes in Nana non Hana database.

If you take a Hana database, the same data due to the nature of column oriented database can be compressed

to 15 GB or this is probably 30 GB.

There is typically a factor of, you know, 10 to 15in terms of compression from the original size.

So this is ten GB.

This is ten GB.

So earlier.

We have so much of data, right?

A total of, say, 300, 600, 600GB, which is on the lower end.

For big companies.

Now, what is the total size?

2050.

65 GB.

There is a compression factor of ten.

And Hannah is way faster, right?

That's the total size of the data is less.

And Hannah is way faster.

And because it's way faster, we don't need so many different instances in the landscape.

All of them can be consolidated into one instance.

And each of these.

Modules like attempts can exist as separate clients.

This is probably the most simplest consolidation that can be done in terms of landscape transformation.

Now how it is done is basically a basic job so you don't have to do anything as a functional consultant.

Your role as a functional consultant.

Is to get the system set up and do regression testing.

That's the only role in case of a landscape transformation.

Well, apart from other things like the the key migration and post migration activities, the key role

is regression testing, ensure that the interfaces are working, ensure that the reports are working,

ensure that the the life cycle is working fine, like the OTC cycle, P2P cycle or finance cycle or

any of that stuff, right?

So that's landscape transformation.

We don't want to talk about other kinds of landscape transformation at this point.

Consolidation is probably the most used landscape transformation.

Now coming back to our migration options.

So there are three types of migration options.

Greenfield Brownfield landscape transformation.

And we know what they are.

Right?

So this is completely new.

This is typically.

The basis migration.

From Assisi to Hana.

All you have to do is regression test.

In this case.

There is no migration, just a basic job.

Or probably there is migration in case you are migrating to S four Hana So landscape transformation

need not be with S four Hana It could be just with Hana database.

It's pure database change.

Well, this involves the standard.

ASAP lifecycle, right.

It could be done with the new Activate methodology, but it requires the standard project management,

you know, project initiation and then blueprint and then realization, blah, blah blah.

Standard ASAP.

Or activate methodology.

Activate is the new SAP project management methodology that supersedes ASAP.

In a brownfield, you can still have the activate methodology.

Or ASAP, but you don't have the entire blueprinting process or realization process because all you

need is a migration so you can have migration.

As using the activation methodology so you can do the entire migration using the Activate methodology.

But remember that brownfield is typically migration except for the legacy part where you need to do

everything from scratch.

This route is completely just a migration activity, right?

Same thing here.

In fact, there is no data migration.

Also, if you are just doing a pure database consolidation, this is not even a data migration.

It's very minimal.

Well.

Very extensive testing is required.

Because it's a new implementation, isn't it?

In this case, it's mostly regression testing.

Right.

Same thing here.

Only regression testing.

Extensive validation also needs to be done because it's a new solution that you're putting all together.

All you have to do in this case in a brownfield implementation is do some post-processing.

That's it.

Apart from regression, once it goes live, all you have to do is do post-processing.

That's it.

Same thing in this case.

If you are doing AS4 Hana implementation along with landscape transformation, you might have to do

both post-processing.

And validation.

But typically validation is not required here.

It's mostly post-processing because it's a migration.

Sometimes you don't even have to do it if you are just consolidating in the database.

Just a bit of regression is more than enough.

This might also be not required depending on what kind of landscape transformation you are doing.

So let's summarize our migration options.

So there are three kinds of migrations, right?

Greenfield, which is starting everything from scratch.

Brownfield, which is a mix of both.

Or it could be just that we are migrating from ECC to S four Hana.

Landscape transformation is a special concept that exists in the world of Hana Hana as a database.

Or as for Hana.

The reason being that because the database size and performance is.

So much better compared to EC.

Multiple systems can be consolidated into one instance.

This results in a huge cost saving and.

A heavy reduction in maintenance.

And multiple systems in one instance always makes things easy.

One Disaster recovery management.

Very few interfaces.

It's all internal, right?

So it's a whole lot of consolidation that can happen in the case of landscape transformation.

And we have seen the features of each of these, like what is greenfield, what is brownfield, what

is landscape transformation?

What kind of methodology do you need to use in do you need to use in each of these cases?

What is your role as a functional consultant in each of these cases?

And what is post-processing?

Where do you where and when do you need to use them?

Right.

These are the migration options available for an S four Hana implementation.
