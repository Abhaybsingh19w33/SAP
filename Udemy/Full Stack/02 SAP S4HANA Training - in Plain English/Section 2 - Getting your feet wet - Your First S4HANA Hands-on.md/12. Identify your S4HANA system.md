The provided text explains the steps to identify whether you are working on an SAP S/4HANA system. It begins by instructing the user to navigate to the system status. In the system status, the first thing to check is the database type. For an SAP S/4HANA system, the database will be listed as HDB, which stands for HANA database. This is a crucial identifier because, unlike other systems that might use databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL, or DB2, SAP S/4HANA exclusively supports the HANA database.

Next, the text advises clicking on the product version button. This action will reveal that the package S4CORE is being loaded. The version number associated with S4CORE, such as 101, corresponds to a specific release version of SAP S/4HANA. For example, version 101 stands for the 1611 release. Although the text mentions that versions have not been covered yet, it indicates that understanding the history and future versions of SAP S/4HANA will be discussed later.

Additionally, by going to the installed products section, you can confirm that the system is an SAP S/4HANA on-premise installation. The text briefly mentions the distinction between on-premise and cloud deployments, noting that this topic will be explored further at a later point. The specific version and service pack level, such as 1610 and ESP level 01, are also provided, giving a complete picture of the system's configuration.

In summary, the text outlines a straightforward method to identify an SAP S/4HANA system by checking the database type, product version, and installed products. This information helps users verify that they are working within the correct environment and understand the specific version and service pack level of their SAP S/4HANA system.


Before we move on to theory, let me quickly tell you how you can identify the system that you're on.

So go to system status.

And.

The first thing that you see is that the database is HDB Hana database.

Now, if you were to look at an XY system, you you'll either see Oracle or Microsoft SQL or DB2 or

any of those databases.

With S four Hana.

The only supported database is Hana database.

And that's what you see here.

And then click on the product version button and you'll see that.

The package S4 core is being loaded.

Now, as for core 101 stands for the version 1611.

Now, we have not covered versions yet, but when we come to versions, you'll understand the history

and the versions and the future of SAP.

S four Hana.

And this is the service pack level.

You go to installed products, you'll see that this is a sap s four Hana on premise.

Again, on premise versus cloud.

We'll talk about it at a later point.

1610.

ESP level zero one.

So this is how you recognize that your system is an sap s four Hana system.
