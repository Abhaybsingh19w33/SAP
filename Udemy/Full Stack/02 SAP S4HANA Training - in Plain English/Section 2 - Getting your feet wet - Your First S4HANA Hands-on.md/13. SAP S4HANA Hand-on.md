# SAP S/4HANA Hands-On

## Introduction
In this section, we will perform a hands-on exercise in SAP S/4HANA. There are two ways to perform transactions in S/4HANA:
1. Traditional GUI (Graphical User Interface)
2. Web-based interface called Fiori

## Creating a Sales Order Using Traditional GUI

### Steps to Create a Sales Order
1. **Navigate to the Sales Order Creation Screen**:
    - Path: `Logistics > Sales and Distribution > Sales > Order > Create`
    - Note: Some enterprise structure elements, customers, and materials have been pre-configured for this demonstration.

2. **Enter Customer Information**:
    - Use the type-ahead feature to find and select a customer.
    - Example: Enter "1" to pull up all customers starting with "1".

3. **Enter Purchase Order Information**:
    - Enter a purchase order number (e.g., "123").

4. **Enter Material Information**:
    - Use the type-ahead feature to find and select a material.
    - Example: Enter material number "M02" and specify the quantity (e.g., "2").

5. **Save the Order**:
    - Ignore any warnings about incomplete documents.
    - Save the order and note the confirmation message (e.g., "Standard Order 5 has been saved").

## Checking Database Table Updates

### Steps to Check Table Updates
1. **Use Transaction Code `SE16`**:
    - Enter the order number (e.g., "5") to view the details of the order.
    - Check the line item and business details.

2. **Check Index Tables**:
    - Examples of index tables: `VAKPA` (orders by partners), `VAPMA` (orders by material).
    - Verify that these tables are updated.

### Understanding Index Tables in S/4HANA
1. **Core Data Services (CDS)**:
    - Index tables in S/4HANA are not physical tables but views created using CDS.
    - A view is a virtual table that combines data from multiple physical tables.

2. **Checking View Definitions**:
    - Use transaction code `SE11` to check the definition of index tables.
    - Example: Check the definition of `VAKPA`.

3. **Proxy Objects**:
    - Use the proxy object associated with the index table to view its definition.
    - Example: Use the program `RUTDDLSSHOW2` to view the definition of the proxy object.

### Explanation
- SAP has eliminated most aggregate and index tables, replacing them with views calculated on the fly.
- This approach ensures compatibility with existing ERP code while simplifying the database structure.

## User Interface (UI) Changes in S/4HANA

### Traditional GUI vs. Fiori
1. **Traditional GUI**:
    - Remains similar to previous versions.
    - Familiar to existing users.

2. **Fiori**:
    - New web-based UI technology developed by SAP.
    - Provides a better user experience compared to the traditional GUI.

### Next Steps
- The next chapter will cover Fiori in more detail.

## Conclusion
- SAP S/4HANA offers a streamlined approach to data management by eliminating physical index tables and using views.
- The introduction of Fiori enhances the user experience with a modern web-based interface.
- Stay tuned for the next chapter to learn more about Fiori.

In this section.

We'll do a hands on in s four Hana.

So this is a hands on.

With S4 Hana.

There are two ways in which you can perform transactions in s four Hana.

One is the traditional guy that we all know.

So this is the guy.

So let's create a sales order.

So how do you create a sales order?

Go to logistics.

Sales and distribution.

Sales.

Order.

And create.

Right.

Now to make this happen.

I've set up some of the enterprise structure elements, customers and materials.

This is all configuration, the regular configuration that you would know if you're an SD consultant.

If you are an M or P consultant.

No worries.

You don't have to bother about this.

And just creating a sales order.

Right click.

Okay.

Then entering a customer.

Well, what's the first thing that you see?

You see that there is a look ahead feature or type ahead feature.

So as soon as I enter twirl or let me go back.

Let me just enter one.

Right.

So it pulls up all the customers.

Let's start with the one.

I do two, one, two.

It gives me all the customers starting with 1 to 12.

So you can select the customer by just double clicking on it.

And then you enter a PO.

Oh.

One, two, three.

Enter.

And then I've created a material, um, zero to.

And then again, you have that type ahead feature, right?

Quantity of two, let's say.

So it says quantity not available.

That's fine.

Then we're going to save this order.

It says the document is incomplete.

We don't care.

Just save it.

Standard Order five has been saved.

Right.

So click.

Okay.

And we're good now.

So in the first section, when we have discovered the innovations in S four Hana.

We have said that there are some base tables and then there are a whole lot of index and aggregate tables.

Let's see how these tables are getting updated.

How do you check for that?

You go to C 16.

Right.

And then say back.

Order number was five.

Right.

So select five.

Click.

Okay.

All right.

We see that this order number five is being updated.

If you double click on that row, you'll see all the details relating to order number five.

All right.

And then there are line item details, business details like Abcd, process flow, details like Vbf,

so on and so forth.

There are some changes on the sales order end.

Some of the tables like status tables are gone now.

But that's not the point we are trying to see.

We're trying to see how the index tables are updated.

Right.

Some of the examples of index tables are what?

V a k pa.

Orders by partners.

Par for partners.

V for orders.

Right.

K for hit.

So if you hit enter V a kpa.

What was the customer number?

Number 12.

And then hit.

Execute.

This table is updated to write, but we have discussed that this table will not be updated.

Why is this table being updated?

Now, it's not just this table.

There are other tables like, say, index by material v a p m a P because materials are the line item

level.

Hit enter.

And say M0 to the material that we have just entered in the order and hit execute.

Again, this table is updated to.

So what is it that we are missing here?

The base tables are updated.

The index tables are updated.

So what's the big deal here?

What's so special about Hana?

We said no longer index tables, right?

So did SAP fall back on the promise?

Not really.

Here is the deal.

Let's go to C11.

The definition for the table.

S 11 and say check out VA, Capa or PMA.

Okay, Let's say VA capa.

An aggregate or index table of all the orders by partner and then click on display.

And it says it's a transparent table.

Meaning it's a table, right?

Just like, okay, this is a table, too.

So do these tables exist in s four Hana?

If yes, the entire purpose is defeated.

Right?

So what's the catch?

The catch is that these tables are not really tables.

Really?

I'm not kidding.

These tables are not really tables.

There's something behind the scenes called as a kids.

See these?

CS stands for Core.

Data.

Services.

Now, this is something we don't need to go into in detail.

What it is essentially for us is a view.

Now, most of you are functional consultants.

And you might not understand the difference between a view and a table.

A table is physical data that resides on the database.

Like, for example, we back.

Is a table.

And that's a transparent table.

Transparent, meaning it's a physical table.

It's not a structure and a view.

Is a combination of tables.

2 or 3 tables combined together to give you a view.

They don't really exist in the database.

It's virtual.

Think of a kids as something similar to that.

It's not exactly that, but it is something similar.

Now, if you go to extras on this table via Capa.

Then click on proxy object.

What do you see there?

You see that there is a proxy object associated with KPA and that is V underscore v KPA.

Just copying that.

And I want to show you what that proxy object really contains.

It's more or less like a view, but you can't view it here.

For example, if you click it here.

And then click display.

It says can do it in 11.

Go to tools in Eclipse.

Well, that's not where we are going to go.

There is a program that is provided.

To view the definition of this proxy object.

So execute this program.

Root DDL is show to.

Enter the name of the proxy object, click Execute.

What do you see here?

This is a script.

You don't have to worry about the script.

But see what.

Are the tables or views that this table or proxy object is pulling the data from?

It's pulling the data from Vee underscore Vaikka Q.

And then Lee.

And then AP and then AP.

These are all the different kinds of partners, regular customers, employees, vendors, so on and

so forth.

Right.

I know.

This is crazy.

Just hold on.

It'll all make sense.

So let's take this guy.

V underscore v acpa underscore Q go back.

And then enter that.

Hit, execute.

And then what do you see here?

Select this ten blah blah blah.

Here are the key tables.

K.

And VPA.

What does it tell us?

That tells us that basically this view.

V underscore v kpa.

Is a is more or less like a view, and it's a combination of both these tables.

So this view.

V underscore v kpa.

Is a combination of the header table and VPA, the partner table.

Right.

So this view is basically a simulation of the data that resides in both these tables.

So essentially the table we akpa that used to exist in ERP before Hana.

Is now a view.

That's a combination of data from header and partner data.

Remember, KPA is just orders by partner.

How many orders did Walmart give us?

The data already resides in these tables, isn't it?

So why create this table or view?

Before Hannah this index table was created so that you can get faster access to orders by partner.

Right.

But the question is why does it still exist in the Hana realm?

Well, we understand that it pulls the data from these base tables, so that's all good.

So this table does not really exist.

It's a view.

But why have the table to start with?

So this is a hack.

This is a hack from SAP to make sure that the transition of code in ERP that already exists works equally

well in S four Hana.

We'll talk more about this when we talk about the future roadmap.

And we will discuss a little more about this.

For now, just understand that SAP has eliminated most of the aggregate tables and index tables.

Instead created them as views which are calculated on the fly.

All right.

So that's all good.

So.

But what about the UI?

Is that it is this s four Hana.

It was no big deal.

Right.

It looks very similar to what we have seen all along for so many years.

So in S4, Hana SAP has given equal importance to UI changes.

But where are they?

They are not on the guy.

But they are on the web.

So SAP has developed a whole new technology called Fiori.

And that's supposed to be way better than the way Guy works.

We're going to talk about it in the next chapter.
