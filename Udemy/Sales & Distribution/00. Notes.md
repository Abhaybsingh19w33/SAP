# Sales order cycle
## What is a sales order cycle?
Every business will have a cycle.

For example, the finance business or the finance department is responsible for looking at what the customer needs to pay (A/R) or receiving payments. So they call it report to record.

Procurement department, which is responsible for interacting with the vendors, getting the goods on time and so on, is responsible for placing the purchase order with the vendor.

Example If Walmart's procurement department were to be taken as an example, they are responsible for dealing with the vendors that supply the goods.

Like if milk needs to be put in the freezer of Walmart. The procurement department will talk to all the different milk vendors. They'll raise purchase orders.

They'll get the goods into the stock, and they'll pay the invoices, meaning pay the money to their vendors. This cycle is called procure to pay.

Procure to pay or P2P. So similarly, there are different business cycles followed by the different departments.

The sales department also follows a cycle. It's called the sales order cycle.

## What is the sales order cycle comprising of? (B2B scenario)

The sales order cycle is best understood with an example. We'll take two companies.

One company say a computer manufacturing company, say HP or Dell or whatever. And this is the company which is selling. So, we are looking at things from a HP's perspective.

### Who is buying? 

Anybody could be buying from you or could be buying from Dell or HP.

Let's take the scenario of HP selling computers to a customer, say Walmart. So, Walmart is our customer. And the companies selling computers to Walmart.

So, Walmart is looking for computers. So, Walmart is inquiring about the different rates of HP, Dell and all the different computer manufacturers.

Now, since we are looking at it from HP's perspective, Walmart is going to send what is called as an RFI or request for information or inquiry RFI.

![alt text](image-187.png)

### What is an RFI?

An RFI is, quite simply, a request for a whole bunch of products. And what are the prices and when we can deliver them by.

So now, from HP's perspective, as soon as they receive this request from Walmart, they're going to say, okay, who is the customer? - Customer is Walmart.

What is the date that we have received this? - Jan, first, 2014 and some other details and then we'll start with the products.

What is it that Walmart is looking for? - They'll specify that in the request. They'll say, I want a particular model of desktop model one.

And how many quantity? - Say 1000.

They want it for a bunch of stores and maybe some laptops, a particular model, maybe 2000 of them and so on.

So, this information is captured in a document from HP's perspective. And this document is just a fancy word. You don't need to use that or think in terms of a document. It's just a collection of some data. So, SAP typically calls it a document.

So, this document is called an inquiry, which is a document created in SAP by HP based on the customer's RFI.

So, customer has asked for desktops, laptops, a certain quantity, and their prices. And HP has created a record in the system and says, okay, you have asked for this, this and this, and the prices are going to be dollar 500 per piece or dollar 800 per piece or whatever HP decides the rate to be.

And as soon as this inquiry is saved in the system, you get an inquiry number in the system that generates its, let's say, 110120, just a number, a sequential number.

HP has created this unique reference called an inquiry document, and this will be sent over to Walmart as a response to their inquiry saying, you know what?

Thank you, Walmart for inquiring with us. We have created an inquiry. Your reference number is 110120. And here are the products that you have inquired for. And these are the prices. And we can provide these quantities by so and so dates.

Finance is responsible for
-	Customers need to pay – A/R
-	Receiving payments

These are called report to record.

Procurement department is responsible for (interacting with Vendors, get goods on time)
-	Placing PO for Vendors
-	Get the goods
-	Pay the invoices
This cycle is called procure to pay (P2P)

Sales department (Sales order cycle)

Example (B2B Scenario)

HP / Dell – Selling computers to Walmart
1)	Walmart – inquire for the computers (RFI – Request for Information or Inquiry)
2)	Seller – for Customer on Date, product, quantity, price
3)	A document will be created and sent to Walmart

![alt text](image-188.png) 

## Quotation

Now Walmart will apply for quotation
Quotation is a formal documents, with terms and conditions, price, quantities, deliverables, adhered to legally.

Validity Dates – the period for which quotations can be applied.

## Create inquiry in system

Tcode – VA11

## Quotation
 
From initial point of view, inquiry is the current doc, and quotation becomes the subsequent doc

From quotation point of view, inquiry becomes the previous doc, and quotation becomes the current doc.

We can create quotation by 2 ways
1)	Creation with reference from inquiry doc (rather than creating another copy of item details, we can use this data from quotation)
2)	Create standalone doc 

TCode – VA21 – To create the quotation

The picking process involves taking goods from a storage location staging the right quantity in a picking area where the goods will be prepared for shipping

![alt text](image-227.png)
 
Packing – if it is need for products to be packed
PGI – POST GOODS ISSUE – After the Goods have left the inventory, the account have to be maintained.

![alt text](image-228.png)
 
Open SO in change mode, then from menu select deliver button for delivery

## Enterprise Structure
   
![alt text](image-379.png)

![alt text](image-380.png)

![alt text](image-381.png)

Company code + Sales Org

Sales Area = ( S Org + D chnl + Div)

Sales Area <- Sales Office <- Sales Group <- People

Company can have multiple plant, but plants can not have multiple company code.

Plant can have multiple storage location for purposes like returns, defects, etc.

Storage location can have multiple ware house.

Plant <- Storage Location <- Warehouse

Plant needs to be mapped with Company code.

Plant  + ( Sales Org + D chnl )

## Configuration

![alt text](image-382.png)

![alt text](image-383.png)
 
### Create sales organization
 
Tcode - SPRO

Enterprise structure -> Definition -> Sales and distribution -> Define, copy, delete, check

![alt text](image-384.png)

Copy from the existing, do not create new.
Because the sales org has a lot of configuration which is already implemented, which we may not be aware of

### Common Distribution Channels and Divisions

Issue here is we have to create the customer for every sales area combination – this will be redundant data or unnecessary to create multiple times.
 
![alt text](image-460.png)

Here we will create a single record and for other combinations we will say them to take data from 10 as reference.
 
![alt text](image-461.png)

![alt text](image-462.png)
 

Here 10 is referring to self, but 20 and 30 is referring to 10 also

The data created here is taken tfor condition record, customer and master data.

Data for condition record can be different for customer and master data.

As long as you have referenced the dist chnl to another dist chnl, you can not create the master data for it or the refereced divisions.

Same with condition records

Here we can do the same for divisions also.

for eg 3 Dist chnl and 3 Division
We had to create 9 records (3 x 3)

but now we have to create only 3 records, where division other division will point to 00 as reference.

![alt text](image-533.png)

TCode - VK11

![alt text](image-463.png)

Here just create data for 10 other will reference this data

### Copy to create your own doc type
 
![alt text](image-486.png)

![alt text](image-536.png)

Number Ranges - This is the range of number the Sales document should create

2 types of number ranges - internal and external

Internal system genearates the number and assign it.

External - we are supposed to enter the number, but should be in the defined range

Item no increment - this is the item is like the 10 20 30 line item. Incrementing by 10

Sub-item increment - this is for BOM


Reference mandatory – will force user to input the quotation number

Here are the option which can be used for reference

![alt text](image-487.png)

![alt text](image-488.png)

![alt text](image-537.png)

in master data division given is 07, but we can allow or deny if we want. We have to configure the division check in document type.

![alt text](image-489.png)
 
Check division – will check if the material is from same division as provided in selection screen of sales order.

![alt text](image-538.png)
 
![alt text](image-539.png)

![alt text](image-490.png)

Check po no – this will check of the duplicate PO exists

Quotation Messages –

Shipping
 
When creating delivery document, it takes delivery doc type from this shipping section of sales doc type.

![alt text](image-542.png)

![alt text](image-494.png)

![alt text](image-543.png)
Here the shipping condition in sales document type will override the shipping conditions in customer master

![alt text](image-544.png)
Imediate delivery - for rush order scenario, where sales order and delivery doc gets created immediately

imp
![alt text](image-545.png)

![alt text](image-546.png)

Del relevant billing type – this will create billing if only the delivery doc is generated, and delivery is completed

Order relevant billing type - this will create billing if only the order doc is generated

![alt text](image-495.png) 

![alt text](image-547.png)

Inter company billing type - this will allow us to deliver the order from different company code, not from the company code they ordered. This might be the case when user needs to get the delivery fast, so it happens to be faster from different company code. Later for accounting the other caompany will create a inter company invoice. 
 
![alt text](image-496.png)

Billing block 

Rush Order – RO - where delivery doc created instantly after creating the order doc

![alt text](image-548.png)

![alt text](image-549.png)

Lead time (days) - we can add certain number of days to requested delivery date

## Item Category

![alt text](image-550.png)

### BOM

![alt text](image-497.png)

![alt text](image-498.png)
   
Tcode – CS01 – To create BOM

![alt text](image-499.png)

![alt text](image-500.png)

![alt text](image-501.png)

#### Item category controls
   
![alt text](image-502.png)

![alt text](image-551.png)

Structural scope - we can configure BOM structure here

Example
![alt text](image-552.png)
```
| TAP
| -> TAN
| -> TAD
```
Here TAN and TAD did not explode becuase scope is not set to anything

![alt text](image-553.png)

TAP exploded becuase it was set to A

![alt text](image-554.png)

![alt text](image-503.png)

![alt text](image-504.png)

![alt text](image-555.png)

![alt text](image-550.png)
Again this is imp for item category determination
 
#### Billing relevance

At header level or part level

At header level – this PC costs 650, includes the following components

At part level – this pc cost $, monitor $, CPU $, etc

![alt text](image-505.png)
 
Here mouse pad (MP) can be free of charge, so no billing required for that

#### Pricing Relevance

Same at header level or component level

At header level- we will show the total price

At component level – show price individually
 
![alt text](image-506.png)

Here it is component level

Here mouse pad (MP) can be free of charge, so no pricing required for that

#### Delivery Relevance & Schedule Line Relevance

It is divided in Order and Quotation

![alt text](image-507.png)
 
PC - Del is relevant in Order, but not for quotation

PC – Sche line is relevant in Orde and also in quotation
 
![alt text](image-508.png)

Here Ext – extended warranty – is not a tangible product, it cannot be delivered, so schedule line cannot for order is not created

You cannot do a delivery unless, you have schedule lines.

If you have schedule line that does not mean you have to do delivery.

#### Item Category control
 
![alt text](image-509.png)
 
![alt text](image-510.png)

## Schedule Line Category

![alt text](image-557.png)

![alt text](image-556.png)

![alt text](image-558.png)

![alt text](image-559.png)

### Movement Types
![alt text](image-560.png)

Why don't we just debit and credit the accounts?

These accounts, instead of introducing a new concept called movement type?

And using it to again do the same thing, debit and credit the accounts because the person in the warehouse is doing this activity.

The activity of throwing the chicken into the garbage. He doesn't know accounting.

He doesn't know what's an inventory account, what's a cost of goods, sold, account and all that.

He is not from an accounting background, so he's not bothered about accounting.

So this is the missing link between accounting and warehouse activities.

So all the person in the warehouse has to know is the right code.

So this three digit code, that's the missing link between movement type and the account, the movement type effects.

### 3rd Party Scenario

![alt text](image-511.png)

Drop Shipment – here the stock does not come to inventory, it directly gets delivered to customer location. 

There is no delivery doc created for this. After Order doc directly Invoice doc is ceated.

TAS – item category

This will trigger the schedule line category CS, which has not movement type, so it’s has no PGI.
 
![alt text](image-512.png)

### Availability and transfer of Requirements
 
![alt text](image-513.png)

No Avl check on service products.

Avl check can be turned on or turned off in schedule line category level.

![alt text](image-561.png)

TCODE - MD04 - MRP

Created an order, the req/demands just transferred to MRP
![alt text](image-562.png)

This shows the req qty
![alt text](image-563.png)

if the flag in the schedule line is marked, then the req will be transferred to MRP

![alt text](image-564.png)

![alt text](image-514.png)

MRP- Material Requirement Planning

## Delivery and Billing Doc Type Config

### 56. Delivery Document Types and Item Categories

![alt text](image-566.png)

But in delivery, there are just two important document types.

One is LF, which is for outbound delivery and for returns we have LR. This one is for inbound delivery.

BOM exists in sales doc level not in delivery doc.

BOM gets flatten out in this delivery doc into delivery group.

This is TAN item category
![alt text](image-515.png)

Delivery group – groups the BOM in a group so that all the components in BOM go together
 
How is the delivery group used?

-> It just groups the components of the bomb together.

Why?

So that the components of the PC like the monitor, keyboard, CPU all go together.

The delivery group is how the delivery document ensures that all the parts of the Bom go together.

![alt text](image-516.png)

You can only create an outbound delivery with reference to a sales order.

Similarly, if we have a return document, meaning somebody authorized a return, then you can create a return delivery.

These two documents should never be created without a reference sales document.
 
![alt text](image-517.png)
 
Relevant for picking - as it name suggests, but in scenario like BOM top part which is phantom part, it does not exist so it is not relevent

StLocation required -  as it name suggests, but in scenario like BOM top part which is phantom part, it does not exist so it is not relevent

Same for StLoc determination

![alt text](image-518.png)

![alt text](image-519.png)

![alt text](image-567.png)

Delivery item category determination

### 57. Billing - Business Scenarios
 
![alt text](image-521.png)

Regular invoice – also tax invoice, commercial invoice, posted to accounts, here the cost of free goods need not to be mentioned

Profarma Invoice- When goods cross a border this invoice is needed, without tax, not posted to accounts, the price of free goods needs to be mentioned

One question that you might have here is why don't we create the invoice? That's the next logical step.

Anyway, right after delivery, you create the invoice.

So why don't we just create it instead of another invoice called the pro forma invoice?

Here is why.

When the truck leaves the plant, only the delivery is created. At that point, the billing document is not created yet. It will only be created overnight when the billing due list runs.

The customs officer does not care about this, right?

When they see the truck, they want to see the value of the goods being declared. So an invoice can be generated called a pro forma invoice, which can be created with reference
to the delivery even before the PGA is done.

And that invoice will look just like a regular invoice.

Here in the example we were giving printer for free which is not mentioned in regular invoice but for customs at border we need to mention some amount.

That is where profarma invoice helps with flexibility, here we can show the amount for printer.
 
![alt text](image-522.png)

F2 - Here std invoice will be created after the delivery and it will be posted to accounts

LF - delivery related invoice will be created with ref of delivery doc, not posted to account

RO - sales ralted invoice will be created with ref of order doc, not posted to account

![alt text](image-523.png)

Credit – over charge a customer

Debit – under charge a customer

Return 

Example

- Create Sales Order
  - Create del doc ( failed becuase warehouse management is not enabled - resolution create transfer order from menu)

    ![alt text](image-568.png)

    ![alt text](image-569.png)

  - do the PGI - VL02N
  - Billing doc - VF01

    ![alt text](image-571.png)

    ![alt text](image-570.png)

    Invoice is generated but not posted to accounts

    ![alt text](image-572.png)

    try posting manually by clicking on green flag

    ![alt text](image-573.png)

    failed cause posting date

    fix - go to ob52 
    change the date there

    ![alt text](image-574.png)

    - doc flow

    ![alt text](image-575.png)

    ![alt text](image-576.png)

now here as an example suppose more tax is debited

![alt text](image-577.png)

to fix this create SO with CR doc type (credit memo - create with ref (invoice doc))

![alt text](image-578.png)

![alt text](image-579.png)

go to line item - conditions tab change the price so that sum is equal to wanted credit amount

![alt text](image-580.png)

Now there is no need for del, directly do the billing

![alt text](image-581.png)

Similarly we can create debit memo with DR doc type

![alt text](image-582.png)

Similarly returns with RE doc type

![alt text](image-583.png)

Here item need to be return first, then we not need to do picking so picking will be 0.

Now click in PGI, here this will perform put away

![alt text](image-584.png)

![alt text](image-585.png)

### 58. Billing - Configuration

Billing Doc types

![alt text](image-586.png)

![alt text](image-524.png) 

Posting block - as it name suggests, but we can post manually
 
![alt text](image-525.png)

To reverse it logically but can not delete the doc, cancel the invoice, or give debit, credit invoice
 
![alt text](image-526.png)

![alt text](image-587.png)

![alt text](image-527.png)

A customer can have multiple invoices, to simplify these.

![alt text](image-588.png)

What's the problem here?

When the accounting department tries to apply the payment, $30,000 against the accounting documents.

The accounting documents, that's important.

The accounting department works with the accounting documents, not with the invoices.

Which accounting document?

The one associated with the invoice list.

No.

Invoice list does not post to accounts because they have already been posted in the original invoice.

So which accounting document?

When the invoice list is created?

Remember we said it will go and change this individual accounting entries to 585858.

Now it's easy.

Payments will be made against these accounting documents.

That's the logic behind invoice lists.

TCode - VF21 - Invoice List

![alt text](image-589.png)

VF21 - This is create invoice list for single doc type at a time 

![alt text](image-590.png)

VF24 - We can use this to create invoice list for multiple doc types

![alt text](image-591.png)

To mark customer for invoice list - we must fill the invoice list dates

![alt text](image-592.png)

![alt text](image-593.png)

### 59. Copy Controls - Possible Data Flows

![alt text](image-594.png)

![alt text](image-595.png)

### 60. Copy Controls - Requirements and Data Transfer Routines

System will check, is this a legal flow, if not, stop it if you want to try to create a quotation and try to deliver that quotation.

Obviously, it'll throw another.

So where exactly is this check happening like this checkpoint when you cross the border?

A similar thing happens in SAP

It's called copy control requirement Sometimes it's also called a requirement routine.

These requirement routines or routines are not just used in copy controls, but used in many places.

That use in many other places where requirement routines are used to evaluate certain things and finally give a decision if you are allowed to do it or not.

Similarly with copy controls, there are a set of routines called data transfer routines.

These routines carry the data from the quotation to the order or from the order to the delivery.

They're just little snippets of code, very similar to copy control requirements, the look at the source document.

Extract the data and push the data into the target document.

Now, how the data is extracted, what kind of code is it?

These are things you don't need to care about in order to end up.

So why are we trying to know these routines?

Your role as a functional consultant is to plug the corresponding routines at the right place, your technical consultant will write routines for you, girl, but you are responsible to configure them in the right place.

### 61. Copy Controls - Standard Requirement Routines

TCode - VOFM - to create routines

![alt text](image-603.png)

![alt text](image-605.png)

![alt text](image-604.png)

If you want to create your own routines, you go and define the routines here.

And once you go and define them and activate them here, you'll get them as a number in the.

## Pricing

![alt text](image-606.png)

### 64. Condition Technique - Field Catalog

![alt text](image-607.png)

Customer group based pricing - 

Field Catalog - A field catalog is a set of fields that can be used to do pricing, discounts, taxes, or anything you do in pricing.

Examples of fields could be material, material, group, customer, customer group, so on and so forth.

There are close to 200 different fields that are provided by SAP right out of the box.

So feel catalog is the list of fields that can be used as the base for pricing.

Now, when I mean pricing, it's a generic statement.

It could mean price, Discount, Tax surcharge, freight, any of these, you could base your freight, for example, on customer group.

### 65. Condition Technique - Condition Tables

A condition table is a database table.

It comprises of one or more than one field from the field catalog.

In this case, the condition table will comprise of material and customer group.

### 66. Condition Technique - Access Sequence

![alt text](image-608.png)

This right here is not a customer group.

This is the distribution channel enterprise structure element, not customer group.

How can we configure this?

In this case, we will be creating two condition tables.

One based on customer group and material, and the other is material plus customer group plus distribution channel.

The distribution channel will be one of the parameters in the field catalog.

![alt text](image-609.png)

The next question becomes which one do you prefer first?

The first table or the second?

Typically the more involved the scenario is, the higher the preference.

If it fails, you default to second.

An access sequence does exactly this.

an access sequence is the sequence in which the condition tables are accessed.

### 67. Condition Technique - Condition Type

![alt text](image-610.png)

Condition type represents the type of computation.

We can do so many things based on customer, group and material.

Using the same combination, we can calculate price, we can do discounts, we can do taxes, surcharges, any of these.

What is the difference between condition table and condition type?

Condition table determines the parameters based on which we are going to compute the price.

Once the parameters are determined in the condition table.

Condition type just dictates how exactly the price is calculated.

Is it based on percentage?

Is it based on volume?

Is it based on dollar value?

Time based.

### 68. Condition Technique - Pricing Procedure & Determination

![alt text](image-611.png)

What is pricing procedure?

Where all the condition types come together.

Typically pricing comes first.-> After that comes discounts.-> After the tax. -> After that fright. -> And after that surcharge.

A pricing procedure is where many different pricing conditions will be put together in a sequence to compute the final price.

![alt text](image-612.png)

The pricing procedure determination is based on three parameters.

- Sales area.
- Document pricing Procedure.
- Customer pricing procedure.

What is this document pricing procedure?
This comes from the sales document type configuration.

And this customer pricing procedure comes from the customer master sales view.

Why is it configured like that?

Well, this is the standard way of determining a pricing procedure.

But.

Why this logic?

Why does SAP allow us to determine the pricing procedure this way?

Basically, SAP is giving us the flexibility to determine pricing based on these parameters.

For example, 

sales area -> That means typically by country.

So you can have different pricing procedures by country.

Us can have its own pricing procedure.

You can have different pricing procedures by business process(doc type), not just by country sales area.

So I said document pricing procedure plays a role by based on the business process.

Similarly, customers also play a role.

All these three parameters put together can be used in any combination to determine your pricing procedure.

### 69. Condition Technique - Condition Records

![alt text](image-613.png)

Everything that you do until step number six. Its all done in SPRO. They're all configuration steps.

Step seven is easy access.

The business users do it themselves.

What do they do there?

They maintain the actual prices, discount percentage, etc for example, until step number six.

We never mentioned a value.

And they do it where in step number seven condition records.

## SD-FI Interface

### 84. Account Determination - Theory

![alt text](image-664.png)

![alt text](image-665.png)

what do we need to know about dual entry accounting?

For every transaction that affects accounts.

There will be a credit and a debit.

A set of credits and debits, in fact.

And the amount of credit.

And the total amount of debit will be equal.

Credit is posted as negative and debit is posted as positive.

How about posting an invoice?

We know it affects the counting, right?

Say this invoice consists of line item ten M0 one.

A price of $100.

And then a regular simple pricing stuff.

Say a discount of $10 that comes to 90, a price of $5, 95 tax of 10%, 9.5.

So the total comes to around 104.5.

Simple example of pricing, right?

In this case.

How are the accounts affected?

I said equal amounts of credits and equal amounts of debits.

Right?

The revenue that needs to be collected from the customer will go in as a credit.

What is the revenue here?

Is the revenue $110 go here and then freight is receivable.

So $5 go here.

Tax is also a receivable.

So 9.5 goes here.

And then the total of 104.5.

Then the customer needs to pay goes as a debit.

So what is the total credits now?

114.511 4.5.

The total of the debits is also 104.5.
