# Sales order cycle
## What is a sales order cycle?
Every business will have a cycle.

For example, the finance business or the finance department is responsible for looking at what the customer needs to pay (A/R) or receiving payments. So they call it report to record.

Procurement department, which is responsible for interacting with the vendors, getting the goods on time and so on, is responsible for placing the purchase order with the vendor.

Example If Walmart's procurement department were to be taken as an example, they are responsible for dealing with the vendors that supply the goods.

Like if milk needs to be put in the freezer of Walmart. The procurement department will talk to all the different milk vendors. They'll raise purchase orders.

They'll get the goods into the stock, and they'll pay the invoices, meaning pay the money to their vendors. This cycle is called procure to pay.

Procure to pay or P2P. So similarly, there are different business cycles followed by the different departments.

The sales department also follows a cycle. It's called the sales order cycle.

## What is the sales order cycle comprising of? (B2B scenario)

The sales order cycle is best understood with an example. We'll take two companies.

One company say a computer manufacturing company, say HP or Dell or whatever. And this is the company which is selling. So, we are looking at things from a HP's perspective.

### Who is buying? 

Anybody could be buying from you or could be buying from Dell or HP.

Let's take the scenario of HP selling computers to a customer, say Walmart. So, Walmart is our customer. And the companies selling computers to Walmart.

So, Walmart is looking for computers. So, Walmart is inquiring about the different rates of HP, Dell and all the different computer manufacturers.

Now, since we are looking at it from HP's perspective, Walmart is going to send what is called as an RFI or request for information or inquiry RFI.

![alt text](image-187.png)

### What is an RFI?

An RFI is, quite simply, a request for a whole bunch of products. And what are the prices and when we can deliver them by.

So now, from HP's perspective, as soon as they receive this request from Walmart, they're going to say, okay, who is the customer? - Customer is Walmart.

What is the date that we have received this? - Jan, first, 2014 and some other details and then we'll start with the products.

What is it that Walmart is looking for? - They'll specify that in the request. They'll say, I want a particular model of desktop model one.

And how many quantity? - Say 1000.

They want it for a bunch of stores and maybe some laptops, a particular model, maybe 2000 of them and so on.

So, this information is captured in a document from HP's perspective. And this document is just a fancy word. You don't need to use that or think in terms of a document. It's just a collection of some data. So, SAP typically calls it a document.

So, this document is called an inquiry, which is a document created in SAP by HP based on the customer's RFI.

So, customer has asked for desktops, laptops, a certain quantity, and their prices. And HP has created a record in the system and says, okay, you have asked for this, this and this, and the prices are going to be dollar 500 per piece or dollar 800 per piece or whatever HP decides the rate to be.

And as soon as this inquiry is saved in the system, you get an inquiry number in the system that generates its, let's say, 110120, just a number, a sequential number.

HP has created this unique reference called an inquiry document, and this will be sent over to Walmart as a response to their inquiry saying, you know what?

Thank you, Walmart for inquiring with us. We have created an inquiry. Your reference number is 110120. And here are the products that you have inquired for. And these are the prices. And we can provide these quantities by so and so dates.

Finance is responsible for
-	Customers need to pay – A/R
-	Receiving payments

These are called report to record.

Procurement department is responsible for (interacting with Vendors, get goods on time)
-	Placing PO for Vendors
-	Get the goods
-	Pay the invoices
This cycle is called procure to pay (P2P)

Sales department (Sales order cycle)

Example (B2B Scenario)

HP / Dell – Selling computers to Walmart
1)	Walmart – inquire for the computers (RFI – Request for Information or Inquiry)
2)	Seller – for Customer on Date, product, quantity, price
3)	A document will be created and sent to Walmart

![alt text](image-188.png) 

## Quotation

Now Walmart will apply for quotation
Quotation is a formal documents, with terms and conditions, price, quantities, deliverables, adhered to legally.

Validity Dates – the period for which quotations can be applied.

## Create inquiry in system

Tcode – VA11

## Quotation
 
From initial point of view, inquiry is the current doc, and quotation becomes the subsequent doc

From quotation point of view, inquiry becomes the previous doc, and quotation becomes the current doc.

We can create quotation by 2 ways
1)	Creation with reference from inquiry doc (rather than creating another copy of item details, we can use this data from quotation)
2)	Create standalone doc 

TCode – VA21 – To create the quotation

## Delivery

![alt text](image-225.png)

This document is created after SO, there can be multiple delivery documents for one SO.

For example feb delivery is created, then another could be created for march also.

![alt text](image-226.png)

The picking process involves taking goods from a storage location staging the right quantity in a picking area where the goods will be prepared for shipping

![alt text](image-227.png)
 
Packing – if it is need for products to be packed
PGI – POST GOODS ISSUE – After the Goods have left the inventory, the account have to be maintained.

![alt text](image-228.png)
 
Open SO in change mode, then from menu select deliver button for delivery
 
![alt text](image-229.png)
 
![alt text](image-230.png)

Here delivery is trying to be create for feb month
 
![alt text](image-231.png)

![alt text](image-232.png)

Here system is confirming the quantity to be delivered in 13 feb when it is actually available

![alt text](image-233.png)
 
Again go back and press deliver button in menu
 
![alt text](image-234.png)

![alt text](image-235.png)

Here we are future dating this, we are providing it future date to process the delivery
 
![alt text](image-236.png)

Here it is asking for picked quantity, if somehow there are not enough goods avl, we can give that picked quantity of the goods here

## Enterprise Structure
   
![alt text](image-379.png)

![alt text](image-380.png)

![alt text](image-381.png)

Company code + Sales Org

Sales Area = ( S Org + D chnl + Div)

Sales Area <- Sales Office <- Sales Group <- People

Company can have multiple plant, but plants can not have multiple company code.

Plant can have multiple storage location for purposes like returns, defects, etc.

Storage location can have multiple ware house.

Plant <- Storage Location <- Warehouse

Plant needs to be mapped with Company code.

Plant  + ( Sales Org + D chnl )

## Configuration

![alt text](image-382.png)

![alt text](image-383.png)
 
### Create sales organization
 
Tcode - SPRO

Enterprise structure -> Definition -> Sales and distribution -> Define, copy, delete, check

![alt text](image-384.png)

Copy from the existing, do not create new.
Because the sales org has a lot of configuration which is already implemented, which we may not be aware of

### Assign sales org to company code   

It was already assigned to 0001 by default, because we copyied it from the sales org which was assigned to 0001 cocode.

![alt text](image-432.png)

![alt text](image-433.png)

### Assign dist chnl to sales org
 
Here Dist cnl is assigned by default due to copying. We need to remove the unnecessary assigments.

![alt text](image-434.png)

![alt text](image-435.png)

![alt text](image-436.png)
  
### Assign divisions to sales org

Same here, delete unnecessary assignments

### Common Distribution Channels and Divisions

Issue here is we have to create the customer for every sales area combination – this will be redundant data or unnecessary to create multiple times.
 
![alt text](image-460.png)

Here we will create a single record and for other combinations we will say them to take data from 10 as reference.
 
![alt text](image-461.png)

![alt text](image-462.png)
 

Here 10 is referring to self, but 20 and 30 is referring to 10 also

The data created here is taken tfor condition record, customer and master data.

Data for condition record can be different for customer and master data.

As long as you have referenced the dist chnl to another dist chnl, you can not create the master data for it or the refereced divisions.

Same with condition records

Here we can do the same for divisions also.

for eg 3 Dist chnl and 3 Division
We had to create 9 records (3 x 3)

but now we have to create only 3 records, where division other division will point to 00 as reference.

![alt text](image-533.png)

TCode - VK11

![alt text](image-463.png)

### Copy to create your own doc type
 
![alt text](image-486.png)

![alt text](image-536.png)

Number Ranges - This is the range of number the Sales document should create

2 types of number ranges - internal and external

Internal system genearates the number and assign it.

External - we are supposed to enter the number, but should be in the defined range

Item no increment - this is the item is like the 10 20 30 line item. Incrementing by 10

Sub-item increment - this is for BOM


Reference mandatory – will force user to input the quotation number

Here are the option which can be used for reference

![alt text](image-487.png)

![alt text](image-488.png)

![alt text](image-537.png)

in master data division given is 07, but we can allow or deny if we want. We have to configure the division check in document type.

![alt text](image-489.png)
 
Check division – will check if the material is from same division as provided in selection screen of sales order.

![alt text](image-538.png)
 
![alt text](image-539.png)

![alt text](image-490.png)

Check po no – this will check of the duplicate PO exists

Quotation Messages –

Shipping
 
When creating delivery document, it takes delivery doc type from this shipping section of sales doc type.

![alt text](image-542.png)

![alt text](image-494.png)

![alt text](image-543.png)
Here the shipping condition in sales document type will override the shipping conditions in customer master

![alt text](image-544.png)
Imediate delivery - for rush order scenario, where sales order and delivery doc gets created immediately

imp
![alt text](image-545.png)

![alt text](image-546.png)

Del relevant billing type – this will create billing if only the delivery doc is generated, and delivery is completed

Order relevant billing type - this will create billing if only the order doc is generated

![alt text](image-495.png) 

![alt text](image-547.png)

Inter company billing type - this will allow us to deliver the order from different company code, not from the company code they ordered. This might be the case when user needs to get the delivery fast, so it happens to be faster from different company code. Later for accounting the other caompany will create a inter company invoice. 
 
![alt text](image-496.png)

Billing block 

Rush Order – RO - where delivery doc created instantly after creating the order doc

![alt text](image-548.png)

![alt text](image-549.png)

Lead time (days) - we can add certain number of days to requested delivery date

## Item Category

![alt text](image-550.png)

### BOM

![alt text](image-497.png)

![alt text](image-498.png)
   
Tcode – CS01 – To create BOM

![alt text](image-499.png)

![alt text](image-500.png)

![alt text](image-501.png)

#### Item category controls
   
![alt text](image-502.png)

![alt text](image-551.png)

Structural scope - we can configure BOM structure here

Example
![alt text](image-552.png)
```
| TAP
| -> TAN
| -> TAD
```
Here TAN and TAD did not explode becuase scope is not set to anything

![alt text](image-553.png)

TAP exploded becuase it was set to A

![alt text](image-554.png)

![alt text](image-503.png)

![alt text](image-504.png)

![alt text](image-555.png)

![alt text](image-550.png)
Again this is imp for item category determination
 
#### Billing relevance

At header level or part level

At header level – this PC costs 650, includes the following components

At part level – this pc cost $, monitor $, CPU $, etc

![alt text](image-505.png)
 
Here mouse pad (MP) can be free of charge, so no billing required for that

#### Pricing Relevance

Same at header level or component level

At header level- we will show the total price

At component level – show price individually
 
![alt text](image-506.png)

Here it is component level

Here mouse pad (MP) can be free of charge, so no pricing required for that

#### Delivery Relevance & Schedule Line Relevance

It is divided in Order and Quotation

![alt text](image-507.png)
 
PC - Del is relevant in Order, but not for quotation

PC – Sche line is relevant in Orde and also in quotation
 
![alt text](image-508.png)

Here Ext – extended warranty – is not a tangible product, it cannot be delivered, so schedule line cannot for order is not created

You cannot do a delivery unless, you have schedule lines.

If you have schedule line that does not mean you have to do delivery.

#### Item Category control
 
![alt text](image-509.png)
 
![alt text](image-510.png)

## Schedule Line Category

![alt text](image-557.png)

![alt text](image-556.png)

![alt text](image-558.png)

![alt text](image-559.png)

### Movement Types
![alt text](image-560.png)

Why don't we just debit and credit the accounts?

These accounts, instead of introducing a new concept called movement type?

And using it to again do the same thing, debit and credit the accounts because the person in the warehouse is doing this activity.

The activity of throwing the chicken into the garbage. He doesn't know accounting.

He doesn't know what's an inventory account, what's a cost of goods, sold, account and all that.

He is not from an accounting background, so he's not bothered about accounting.

So this is the missing link between accounting and warehouse activities.

So all the person in the warehouse has to know is the right code.

So this three digit code, that's the missing link between movement type and the account, the movement type effects.

### 3rd Party Scenario

![alt text](image-511.png)

Drop Shipment – here the stock does not come to inventory, it directly gets delivered to customer location. 

There is no delivery doc created for this. After Order doc directly Invoice doc is ceated.

TAS – item category

This will trigger the schedule line category CS, which has not movement type, so it’s has no PGI.
 
![alt text](image-512.png)

### Availability and transfer of Requirements
 
![alt text](image-513.png)

No Avl check on service products.

Avl check can be turned on or turned off in schedule line category level.

![alt text](image-561.png)

TCODE - MD04 - MRP

Created an order, the req/demands just transferred to MRP
![alt text](image-562.png)

This shows the req qty
![alt text](image-563.png)

if the flag in the schedule line is marked, then the req will be transferred to MRP

![alt text](image-564.png)

![alt text](image-514.png)

MRP- Material Requirement Planning

## Delivery and Billing Doc Type Config

### 56. Delivery Document Types and Item Categories

![alt text](image-566.png)

But in delivery, there are just two important document types.

One is LF, which is for outbound delivery and for returns we have LR. This one is for inbound delivery.

This is TAN item category
![alt text](image-515.png)

BOM exists in sales doc level.

BOM gets flatten out in this delivery doc into delivery group.

Delivery group – groups the BOM in a group so that all the components in BOM go together
 
![alt text](image-516.png)
 
![alt text](image-517.png)
 
![alt text](image-518.png)

![alt text](image-519.png)

![alt text](image-520.png)

Billing 
 
![alt text](image-521.png)

Profarma Invoice- When goods cross a border this invoice is needed, without tax, not posted to accounts, the price of free goods needs to be mentioned
 
![alt text](image-522.png)

Regular invoice – also tax invoice, commercial invoice, posted to accounts, here the cost of free goods need not to be mentioned
 
![alt text](image-523.png)

Credit – over charge a customer

Debit – under charge a customer

Return 

![alt text](image-524.png) 
 
![alt text](image-525.png)

To reverse it logically, cancel the invoice, or give debit, credit invoice
 
![alt text](image-526.png)

![alt text](image-527.png)

A customer can have multiple invoices, to simplify these.
