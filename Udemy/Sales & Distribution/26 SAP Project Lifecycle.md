Okay, wonderful SAP Project Lifecycle.

[COUGH] What is SAP Project Lifecycle?

SAP Project Lifecycle.

So any project may be Java

project, has a lifecycle.

If you guys have some software engineering background.

You'll understand what a lifecycle means.

It's also called SDFC, Software Development Lifecycle.

The SAP Project Lifecycle is also very similar.

Only things is, the terminology is a little different.

An the purpose of this class, is to go over the SAP specific terminology.

And SAP-specific project anthropology, and lifecycle.

Okay, but in your mind, if you have already left SDLC?

If you enrolled a typical waterfall model.

You can delete it too.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

If you do not understand the SDLC life cycle,

then you can just follow may be my voice.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Okay.

[COUGH] At a high level.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

These are the five steps, in the project management.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Project Initiation.

Requirements.

Blueprint.

Realization.

Go-Live.

I have simplified things down, and only given you five steps.

As we move forward to the next slide,

centre slide, we go forward.

like I said these series of steps.

Are very similar to a project.

Typical project like this.

Nothing different.

The regular waterfall model, of project initiation requirement gathering.

Now punctual high level design, low level design.

And then realization, means implementation,

and then go live, so same steps, no different.

Only the terminology here is different.

They have their differences for example blueprint,

is temporarily divided in a digital SDLC

lifecycle, high level design, low level design.

That's what is called Specific Java project, in a digitalised project.

And one of the words

is the blueprint.

That we'll talk about in the next set of slides.

Realization.

Again, a very SAP specific word.

In the general SCLC life cycle.

Renovation can be called

implementation or coding, codes.

Okay, these are some of [INAUDIBLE] that

you can draw, with the SDLC lifecycle.

Okay, next slide, so let's go step by step, first

step in the high level is project initiation, right?

So what does the project initiation comprise of?

[BLANK_AUDIO]

It's comprised of four steps.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Scope definition, Estimation, Staffing, Licensing.

There could be other steps.

There are other steps that are very specific to a project.

But, at a minimum, you'll have these four steps.

Let's take an example, there is them we

have been taking an example of them Dell,

Dell already, has been implemented.

Now, Dell is software

a small company say which

specialises in making mattresses.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Okay, Dell has purchased this company.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

And this company is also selling some of the products say like accessories.

Their sales products needs to be incorporated into Dell's process.

They are selling Dell products, like some accessories like

hard drive and maybe some covers, vanity covers.

Or some products

[INAUDIBLE]

accessories

[INAUDIBLE] company.

Compaq and HP were matched together at one point in time.

Maybe seven years back, eight years back, [INAUDIBLE]

Compaq and HP, that could be another example.

In which case, either of these cases, all these

products now need to be sold through Dells business process.

But Dell sells this product here.

So this is a new project.

Example of a new project.

So this project somebody Dell, like a project manager.

When we initiate the project, when we initiate this project,

that is called project initiation, okay, now we need to do

this we need to incorporate this products into the Dell.

So what do we need to do?

We will inform the team, that will define this whole, very small

team, five members, four members, three members very small.

And it will be paying this co partner correct [INAUDIBLE] project, meaning.

Okay, what are we going to do in this project, and what are we not going to do?

This is very important.

What we are going to do, what we are not going to do?

As an example.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

We are going to do in SAP, we are going to do incorporate these

product, into the same process, letting them through.

Okay?

In the scope definition, this is what is defined, what is in scope?

Okay, sales processes of

all these products, okay.

Master Data, so on, then the scheme.

We explicitly identify the out-scope also.

What is out-scope of the scope?

Let's say this company, is interfacing

with another company, or another vendor

for some products, and Dell thinks that

this is no longer required [INAUDIBLE].

We don't need to bring back out-scape.

And maybe outdated,

customers need not be part of [INAUDIBLE], outdated maybe be part of that.

So on and so forth we outer source?

[INAUDIBLE] So that the project can be clearly

measured, and identified, so you know what it's going to put out, [INAUDIBLE].

Very, very important part.

And

step number two.

Is estimation.

What are we estimating?

We are estimating, how long it

takes to complete this project?

And how is estimation done?

Okay, how much configuration is required, how much coding is required,

how much user training is required, from these we will estimate how many man hours?

It's been to complete all the activities [INAUDIBLE] in this scope of the project.

Whatever has been listed in the scope of the project,

will be estimated for the number of manners.

Man hours and that destination,

okay, about how many hours,

about 3000 man hours.

Mm will require 1000 man hours.

So on and so forth.

The

next step is staffing.

Okay, we required, we know roughly required how many hours we require?

You know we need to find somebody to do that for us.

Ready.

Approached the staffing so we will go out and get this compartment, two

sd compartments, two mm compartments, three about

compartments, four, so on and so forth.

Depending on how late we want to finish the process.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Right.

Example, for LD we have to say the total estimate

which is, [INAUDIBLE] 32,00 man hours.

In order to do staffing, what would we do.

You can say, okay.

Car month, car day somebody in the

compartment will spend six hours or eight hours.

For a week, five.

40 hours.

How many

I was in the one month passive four weeks, four weeks for the course.

160 hours.

So car mean, a person in an empty compartment can spend 160 hours.

For the missed purchased, it doesn't do 100.

And this scope definition of project initiation, will also

define by what target date, we have to complete the project.

Lets say six months.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

In six months we have to complete this project.

If you want to complete the project in

six months, how many energy consultants are required?

So, each consultant per month can do 160 hours.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Okay, so 3,200 man hours divided by 6 is 500

around five hundred and something man hours.

Per month, we declare [INAUDIBLE].

You just want something that can do 60.

So how many [INAUDIBLE] in the class?

500?

So roughly [INAUDIBLE] then at the rate of 160 per man hours.

The project can be completed in 3,200 man hours in six months.

Generally, that's how staffing is done.

The next thing is licensing.

Licensing means, how many SAP licenses have to be bought?

How many production licenses do you need?

How many other product confirmations do we need.

And then hardware,

sizing.

So many different things happen.

But we are interested in this high level activity [INAUDIBLE].

Okay, this is project initiation.

So, back to project initiation.

We have a [INAUDIBLE].

And then we're ready to start the project.

[INAUDIBLE] Okay.

And then maybe one lead and that lead let's say, will just sit back.

See what else it is we need, we need 34 people to

divide the finish and the team comprises of program, metal, and circuit.

And the we have MMT, similarly [INAUDIBLE].

So what do you do

when [INAUDIBLE].

Let's say we're on [INAUDIBLE].

[INAUDIBLE] okay I didn't

decide the super users.

Identify the super users.

Who is the super user?

The super user is somebody who's responsible

for a small test of this mass process.

Say, master data [INAUDIBLE] masters, one super rig, just leave it like that.

And just write it down.

So overall, if you are independent

business process, master data,

prising, OTC, interfaces, and so on.

So master data maybe.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Louise, Gabby.

Do you have the people responsible for that?

That particular business process.

And Alice.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

And give me another name.

I'm short of names.

[INAUDIBLE].

>> [LAUGH] No, see the, in the team, right?

You mean [INAUDIBLE].

>> Oh, okay.

Okay.

>> [INAUDIBLE] you want the unit of it?

>> No, no, no.

[INAUDIBLE].

[INAUDIBLE] I want to [UNKNOWN] in my team, so give me another name.

>> D or whatever.

>> Genie in the bottle.

Now these are those super users.

Next thing is second step, we set up workshops.

[UNKNOWN] requirement gathering, the second step is set up workshops.

What is a workshop?

[INAUDIBLE] five workshops right here 1,2,3,4,5.

[INAUDIBLE] one for master data, two for pricing, three

for OTC, four for [UNKNOWN] and five is [INAUDIBLE].

So I even say okay, master data and the pricing, okay?

[INAUDIBLE] three and four [INAUDIBLE] OTC and master's data.

[INAUDIBLE] So these are

the responsibilities

given to you guys.

So what you will do is, each of you, depending on.

So what does Padma have, she has to do, she is responsible

for master data pricing and logistical components.

[INAUDIBLE] is responsible also for master data, pricing and OTC and interfaces.

[INAUDIBLE] is responsible for interfaces and is responsible for OTC.

So let me divide

that.

And right now we'll set up meeting.

[INAUDIBLE] Mary and G, so that the times don't crash.

Okay Monday morning 8-12 P.M. 8-12

noon, master data, one class one workshop.

We will invite Mary, will set them, hopefully

have a meeting with her and invite Mary.

[INAUDIBLE] She will explain what is the

master data that she tells him [INAUDIBLE].

She will explain that to us.

And right then [INAUDIBLE] pen and paper, and start noting things down.

If they have any questions, if you guys have any questions you can ask me.

Okay, how about this, what is the whole group?

What fields are required there?

[UNKNOWN].

You can ask questions if you have them, I'm sure I will answer your questions.

[COUGH]

You make notes, but notes you should not use, okay.

It's not like training notes, huh.

[INAUDIBLE] So like that you'll complete all the workshops.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Okay?

The third step is playbacks.

What is a playback?

It's not like playback [INAUDIBLE].

We don't have a thing.

But you would have to present it to the users.

Some companies thought [INAUDIBLE], some companies call

it, you know, [INAUDIBLE], different kind of things.

But the bottom line is, you have to present all of the

stuff, whatever you created [INAUDIBLE] PowerPoint and then show it to them.

This is what we understood out of your business process meeting.

Are we right?

Cuz they have experts.

We are just meddling their understanding, that's it.

All right.

Then they will go back and forth til they produce some

suggestions, and then finally they will understand where the income comes from.

Okay, this is what a process is.

And then, next step.

The third major milestone is blueprint preparation.

What is a blueprint?

A blueprint is a document prepared by you.

How many blueprints have we prepared in this case?

One blueprint for master data, one blueprint for OTC [INAUDIBLE].

Meaning?

How many documents need to be created.

What kind of optimum employees required blah, blah, blah.

How many [INAUDIBLE] et cetera.

The third thing is pricing.

How to integrate their products in to our pricing strategy so on and so forth.

Let's look and see different blueprint what we created.

This could be one blueprint which remains all the three aspects.

I [INAUDIBLE] became blueprints which was

split each individual active team with blueprint.

But depends on the nature of the project and how big that project is.

If it is a small $1 million dollar project,

then all of this will be done in one document.

if it is a $20 million deposit, then you may [INAUDIBLE] ten documents.

That

is [INAUDIBLE].

Okay?

The blueprint preparation and then the second important [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE].

So normal Word document in which you will write

down [UNKNOWN] business process and this tend to be

okay, as is, meaning as it is right now and to be.

Okay we're going to do it like this.

You want to do it like this.

Understood the point?

As is and [UNKNOWN].

That's the blueprint, blueprint is [UNKNOWN] fractionally

as [UNKNOWN] clearly [UNKNOWN] as is the process [INAUDIBLE].

So I'm just trying to write it down.

AS-ES, meaning, [INAUDIBLE].

TO-BE, meaning, we want, you, you just want this to be like this.

AS-ES is optional.

TO-BE is what a blueprint is.

Okay?

AS-ES you can put it just as an option okay.

Apparently it happened like this but this work [UNKNOWN] this one.

The second step is sign off.

What is a sign off?

The users need to sign off on the blueprint that you've prepared.

This is just a safety precaution.

Okay?

So that the users understand and users

confirm that yes, this blueprint is correct.

This is what [INAUDIBLE] wanted it to be.

[INAUDIBLE] playback [INAUDIBLE],

you'll tend to the blueprint

document for the user [INAUDIBLE].

Which is good.

Physical confirmation from the user.

Okay?

Next step.

[COUGH] Realization.

Now, we know what needs to be done.

The user has confirmed that this is what needs to be dome.

Realization is the [INAUDIBLE] can be the next step.

The largest step among these five steps.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

There are how many steps here?

Six steps.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Let's start with the first step.

Functional specification.

What is a functional specification?

These are the blueprints.

Let's say [INAUDIBLE] have a [INAUDIBLE] blueprint.

[UNKNOWN]

Now the project manager has thought at maybe no I thought

maybe as a leader in fact maybe this is not enough, we need one more resource.

So I go to the project manager and say, [UNKNOWN] typing [UNKNOWN].

it can complete by itself, we need some help.

Supply management [INAUDIBLE] get another resource.

And that resource, doesn't know what's going on.

He will have to read the

[INAUDIBLE] blueprints to understand what has happened.

[INAUDIBLE].

Okay?

Here we go to your blueprints and understand what has happened.

[UNKNOWN] reason may [UNKNOWN].

Okay?

So, functional specification, what is the functional specification?

Functional specification typically contains what needs to be done

for that particular process that you defined in the blue print to happen.

I give you one simple example.

In the blueprint, you specify that the master data needs to be configured in such

a way that there are, how many types of master data in this company.

Okay, they have distributors, resellers and end users.

They have distributors and resellers and end users.

Distributors have, needs to have this set up fees, resellers need

to have this set up fee so on and so forth.

And then some other thing.

The distributor number where you need it to start with [INAUDIBLE]

reseller's number where you need to start [UNKNOWN].

This is all what you write in a blueprint document.

So in a functional specification of derived [UNKNOWN] configuration.

Okay.

Or what is it?

Numbering okay.

Numbering goods that need to be created 0001.

[INAUDIBLE] 0001.

It needs to have these properties blah blah blah.

And Z0002.

This is for the distributors [UNKNOWN].

This is the configuration document.

[UNKNOWN] and this is [UNKNOWN] what is the

[UNKNOWN] in between there could be another

step, which is technical specification.

For example in order to do this, let's say that only by

configuration alone you can't access, you need some.

Coding.

Then, we are [UNKNOWN] disengaged.

And, he will be writing the specification which [UNKNOWN].

Okay, I have to write this piece of code in

this user examp, in this [UNKNOWN] so on and so forth.

Let's [UNKNOWN] specification.

In some posits, the functional specification and the

technical specification can be combined together into one document.

In some posits, functional specification and technical specification,.

Big

surprise but most of the patient [UNKNOWN] maintain function specification.

The second [UNKNOWN] you have the

option of specification [UNKNOWN] sometimes.

That you [INAUDIBLE] technical specification will

be done by the technical guy.

One second guys, hold on

[BLANK_AUDIO]

[BLANK_AUDIO]

[BLANK_AUDIO]

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Okay, fine.

So we were talking about

functional specifications and technical specifications, right?

So, we have completed that [UNKNOWN].

The documents are complete.

And then the second step is an actual [UNKNOWN]

which will go [UNKNOWN] the customization also.

Using the configuration, [UNKNOWN] function specification.

And the boxes we start doing with the coordinates with the necessity, to achieve

the functionality that we intended to achieve in the functional specification.

Well at this point, don't think too much about these two steps.

So I know what we do with the other, blah, blah, blah.

[UNKNOWN] steps, in [UNKNOWN] for example easy

for you, something like a customer password.

Okay.

And if you start to think about more complicated

than this process, then your [UNKNOWN] definitely

[BLANK_AUDIO]

[INAUDIBLE] you activation is done, your [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE].

So as it's done, you go to unit testing.

What does unit testing mean?

You are testing that small piece of

functionality that you are trying to teach here.

That's it the customer master the customer [UNKNOWN].

Is that working fine?

next maybe you want to test the [UNKNOWN] only [UNKNOWN].

[UNKNOWN] you should

first [UNKNOWN]

properly [UNKNOWN].

Then the next [UNKNOWN] will be [UNKNOWN]

I have patient [UNKNOWN] it is working find.

That's called unit [UNKNOWN].

Next we have indication testing.

Indication testing means.

The largest test of a particular piece of functionality let's say [INAUDIBLE] you

do have interesting like, okay, orders created, orders coming in from interface

of [INAUDIBLE] so some place orders coming, hitting in here.

This piece of functionality we test it.

[UNKNOWN] will be distant

[UNKNOWN] be distant billion will be distant.

[UNKNOWN] this is one who [UNKNOWN].

An integration [UNKNOWN] and [UNKNOWN] maybe [UNKNOWN].

And information was to be sent to

some extent [UNKNOWN] for the customer

[UNKNOWN] properly [UNKNOWN] customer

[UNKNOWN], okay next is [UNKNOWN].

What are you doing user [UNKNOWN]

user acceptance

so the user will be set up in

a group.

Armani, Genie, and Johnny they'll all come.

Each particular feature functionality will be tested

by them with your help of course.

And they will ask question, they will ask modifications and

finally they will say "Okay, good to go, try it now."

.

.

Yeah.

I'm in up on this part.

Yes, it is working.

You may be the middle kind of.

Users have to sign off on the processing.

Yes, it is working fine.

Then.

Finally, go live, go live is where you take the system live.

All right, take the system live.

Everything is done.

[UNKNOWN] is fine.

We'll accept that we have configured it fine.

Now, you have to take the system live.

How that they are confident whatever happened to them happen to them.

What is next steps.

First step is data migration [UNKNOWN] have some data right?

[UNKNOWN] date, customer, material, orders.

That data needs to be brought into, yes, right?

This is called data migration.

Data migration is a [INAUDIBLE] so let's not get too overwhelmed that way.

The model, the models topic is going to be, like data migration.

So, I'm going to talk about.

The detail that is for that necessary [UNKNOWN] step by step.

[UNKNOWN] Okay one [UNKNOWN] over activities

in the day tomorrow [UNKNOWN].

Next step is user training the user have

to be trained on the [UNKNOWN] okay.

Right now we are doing a customer master

like this in the [UNKNOWN] system that's it.

Right now you're doing it [INAUDIBLE] probably

have to do [INAUDIBLE] so on and so forth,

okay.

The next step is Go-Live.

So somebody has to go?

So generally, it happens all weekend.

So we will go on a Friday, go have a blast,

a good time and you guys will be slogging all weekend.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

In a dungeon, a room, a parted room.

Doing the operations of Go-live right?

Okay, what are the activities that needs to be done?

What are the sequence of activities you need to do?

Because you cannot do that on the model,

it has to be done in a specially treatments.

And then the last thing to be migrated [UNKNOWN] And

even before all of that, continuation needs to be migrated.

Even confirmation needs to go step by step.

Again as part of our activities, the model.

Okay that's it the [UNKNOWN] system [UNKNOWN]

is a specific space that generally

last [UNKNOWN] weeks system there will

be lots of problems initially.

[UNKNOWN] so there will be lots of problems [UNKNOWN].

It's like being in marriage.

There's always gonna be problems.

Something is missing here.

Something's missing there.

So there needs to be somebody who.

>> [CROSSTALK].

>> Hello?

Hello?

>> Yeah, I was saying that was a bad example.

Let's [INAUDIBLE] again.

[INAUDIBLE].

Any project, you know after the project data.

>> This is general support right?

>> [INAUDIBLE] is specifically is a support, but overall it's support yes.

>> Yes.

>> It is different from other parts

of support [INAUDIBLE] overall [INAUDIBLE] very specific.

Support that is offered immediately after

[UNKNOWN] the operation [UNKNOWN] you have done

an operation [UNKNOWN] the [UNKNOWN] operation

is done [UNKNOWN] has been operated on.

[UNKNOWN] Applied and the patient is resting in the ICU [UNKNOWN].

[INAUDIBLE] Yeah?

[INAUDIBLE] So we take special care, anything that comes up.

>> Also called there's a warranty [INAUDIBLE] used to call [INAUDIBLE].

The warranty [INAUDIBLE].

>> Warranty [INAUDIBLE].

>> Yes.

>> [INAUDIBLE] There could be an extended warranty for six months.

That's it that could be also [UNKNOWN] training is a very specific

[UNKNOWN] instead care of the project that can be patient is basic something to have.

Anything could happen make sure that you know you do everything in your capacity.

So, ensure that the project [INAUDIBLE] goes smoothly and

any errors that come up we need fixed immediately.

And that changes the base model.

You don't treat the patient unless you [INAUDIBLE] and after that.

I think the hand off, the hand off is

very [INAUDIBLE] we call it [INAUDIBLE] trying and have

[INAUDIBLE] name of people or they're higher [INAUDIBLE] so,

you hand it off to that person and finally.

Close [UNKNOWN] you close the project okay everything is done [UNKNOWN]

some of the users [UNKNOWN] access every failure when you go.

You [UNKNOWN] things

will happen but [UNKNOWN] so the [UNKNOWN] be closed and [UNKNOWN].

And now for that, [UNKNOWN] simple tactic.

This is the

overall lesson.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Okay, so let me stop here and see if you have any questions.

On [INAUDIBLE] You have any questions in general.
