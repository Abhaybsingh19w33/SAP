# 37 Business Processes

Okay.

In this section we are going to talk about business process, business process.

So what is a business process?

Let's take the example of a company

that sells, say, servers.

Now those big computer machines

and also software.

Now, the way the servers are sold is totally different from the way the software is sold.

How, you might ask me which servers?

These are like really expensive pieces of hardware, right?

So.

So with servers.

There's a sales guy.

Who goes after potential customers.

So these are all potential buyers.

And maybe some of them are interested in buying this product.

Right.

And then and then they'll ask you for a quotation.

And this quotation goes through a whole bunch of iterations.

Like price increase, price decrease.

Quantity increase approvals.

Approvals, so on and so forth.

And then some of them might actually go ahead and place an order.

Thus this order is for is to deliver a couple or 10 or 20 of these servers and

our warehouse will have those servers available and they will deliver the servers out to the customer.

And then our software installation expert or hardware installation expert will go and install and configure

the hardware and the necessary software.

So demo to the customer.

The customer likes it and probably gives you a confirmation that everything is fine and you're going

to send an invoice to the customer, which is a fancy word for a bill and the customer is going to pay

the money.

Okay, so that's how the servers are sold.

Let's come back.

The software.

So how is software solved?

Because software does not have inventory, right?

So no physical inventory.

And say, for example, the software that's sold here is a it's not like enterprise software.

It's not like $100,000 or $1 million.

It's a software that's sold in a CD and it's less than $100.

And the way it's sold is it could be sold as a freebie

along with the rebate, for example, or it could be sold as a freebie along with some hardware to improve

the hardware sales.

Or it could be tagged along with another channel partner to increase the sales of another product.

So in this case there is no quotation, there is no order, there is no delivery, maybe there is electronic

delivery, but that's about it.

There is no installation and configuration you have to do.

The customer will install it by himself.

And of course there is invoicing which will happen in a different way compared to the way that we do

invoicing for servers.

Let's take another example.

Say there is a power company.

A power generating company.

Write and say this is based on coal thermal power station.

Right.

So this runs 24 by seven and so needs access to a whole bunch of coal.

Right?

All right.

So this is all cool and it cannot wait for the call to come like every day.

It doesn't do like that.

So it has a vendor, maybe an open coal mine.

They will be delivering the goods or delivering the coal to the power station.

Now, how will they deliver it?

The way they deliver it is not the way a server is sold, right?

A server is like, okay, I need one server or ten servers, you deliver it to the customer and that's

done.

But with coal, it's like the coal mine is going to continuously dump a whole bunch of coal, Say,

you know, at minimum maintain 100,000 tons of coal over here as a consignment.

Make it available to the power station.

And and whenever the power station requires coal, it will withdraw

from the coal dump.

And then if it doesn't like it, it will return it.

So this process is called a consignment.

And if the coal mine thinks that this power station is not consuming enough from the dump, it can probably

sell it to another coal station.

To another power station.

So this model is different from the way servers are.

Software is sold.

Let's take another example.

We have a power station.

In this power station is selling to the grid.

You know, the California grid or whatever.

This grid supplies to homes like yours and mine.

Right now, nobody goes around and sets up a power station just like that.

The power station always has a contract with the grid.

This contract could be saying that, you know, you got to buy electricity from me for, say, ten years

at say, you know, so many megawatts.

And this same company will have a contract with the coal mine that they have to supply the coal at so

many tons per day or so many tons per month for a period of ten years that you can just go about and

set up a power station and then expect customers to come in.

So this shows that there is a contract involved between two parties.

So these are all examples of business processes.

So there is quotations, there is orders, there is deliveries, there is invoicing, and then there

is invoicing without delivery.

In this case, and then there is.

And then there is a consignment which is not really a sale, but it results in a sale after some time.

And then there are contracts.

These are all different examples of business processes.

So in the next chapter, we will see what a document type is and how it's related to a business process.

# 38 Document Type

Okay, now that we have seen what business processes, let's move on to the document type and how it's

related to a business process.

Right.

So document type.

A document type represents the characteristics.

Characteristics of a business process.

What do I mean by that?

Let's take the same example.

So this company, right, sells servers.

And sells software.

And when it's selling a server.

So it's going through a salesman who contacts a list of.

Potential customers and out of them, some customers are interested to proceed forward.

So in this case, these customers are not really interested at this point to buy the product, but they

just want to have a look and feel of it, maybe find out if it's really useful and they might ask you

for a quotation

quotation and then maybe iterate over the quotation.

At this point, you see, this quotation is a business process.

Receiving a quotation from a customer does not mean that you can ask your factories to start producing

that server or piece of hardware, right?

So demand is not transferred to production.

Your production facility, which could be in China or the US, is not need to start producing yet because

it's just a quotation.

The customer just asked for a quotation.

Also, a quotation will have a whole bunch of statuses like, you know what?

It's 10%.

True, because it's a sales negotiation cycle, right?

It's 10% true.

Or it requires a VP approval or it's a hot lead versus a cold lead, meaning it might not even go through

or it might go through with a high probability and maybe it's approved internally or by the customer

or maybe it's just lost.

These are all statuses.

Now, an order need not have a status, but a quotation could have a status.

After the quotation is done, let's say the customer agrees to buy it.

Maybe he will place an order and when an order is placed, that's when the customer agrees to buy the

product.

And when the customer agrees to buy the product, we can signal our manufacturing, either the vendor

who's producing and shipping it to us or our factory, which is actually producing the goods so you

can pass the demand.

To the factory.

And this document will have a corresponding delivery and invoice also linked to it because a quotation

will not be delivered anyway.

We know it, so you don't need to have the quotation to be configured with the corresponding delivery

in case if delivery is asked or corresponding billing in case billing is asked because quotation is

not delivered, quotation is not billed whereas an order.

Is manufactured or procured.

It's delivered.

It's invoiced.

So this is a different business process altogether.

And maybe after an order is placed, you really check for the credit that you can extend to that customer.

Maybe because not all customers are equal, right?

A Fortune 500 company could be extended a great amount of credit, but an offbeat family owned company

might want to be a little careful.

Right.

So credit management is required here, credit management.

But in this case of quotation, there's no need for a credit management because it's more or less like

an inquiry, a more formal form of it.

Okay?

And after an order is placed, it's delivered, right?

So it's delivery.

And then delivery is going to have details like picking, packing the route that it needs to take to

reach the customer.

So on.

Right.

And then the hardware is installed configured and the customer agrees to it and says, okay, I'm good.

And then of course, once the customer agrees.

It's invoiced, meaning the bill is sent to the customer and the customer pays it.

So this business process will have things like can we cancel the invoice or not?

If there are more than one invoice in a month, like if the customer buys like regularly, like one

server today, one server at the end of the week and maybe ten servers in a month.

Can we produce all of them in an invoice list as opposed to an individual invoice?

That depends on the choice of the customer.

So these are all properties of the invoice or the business process called invoicing that we are trying

to document.

Another example is can you post negative values?

Right.

So this over here is an example.

So if we go back, these

so SAP has broadly classified all these different business processes into three different classes.

Okay.

The first one quotation enquiry orders.

Okay.

Is called as sales.

Let me put it in a different colour.

So this is called sales.

So this is one type of categorization or classification, the big one.

And next we have delivery.

This is the second kind of classification of the different business processes.

And the third of course, is invoicing.

Okay, so there are three different kinds of business processes in sales and distribution.

So let me go here and say in SD there are three different classes or three different categories of business

processes, business processes.

Sales delivery and billing or invoicing.

And each of them is configured in a different place.

Now, sales, for example, could have more categorization underneath it.

We'll talk about that in a minute.

And deliveries, of course, are different Categorization.

Billing can have different categorization.

If you want to give me some examples.

Sales is an example of a sales categorization is an inquiry, which is different from a quotation,

which is different from an order, which is different from a consignment, which is different from a

contract.

And each of them actually represent a category.

Category of a sales business process.

Similarly, in delivery, we're going to have different categories of business process like regular

deliveries, expedited deliveries, returns.

And these are delivery categories.

Right.

And invoices have their own item categories, and invoices have their own billing categories like Standard

invoice.

If you want to give money to the customer, like if you have overcharged the customer, you would do

a credit.

If you have undercharged the customer, you would do a debit memo.

If you want to do corrections, there is invoice corrections.

These are all examples of billing categories.

Okay, now where is the document type?

I'm talking about business processes.

Three different classifications of business processes, sales delivery, billing.

And then underneath each of them, I'm talking about sales categories, delivery categories and billing

categories.

So where is the document type?

A document type.

Represents all the variations that are possible in a particular category.

For example, if you're talking about a quotation which is of a category type quotation in sales, a

document type represents all

the properties of how a quotation should behave.

This is called as a template.

So document type represents a template that's used to characterize how a business process of a particular

category behaves.

We'll talk about template in the next chapter.

# 39. Document Type Template

In the SD, there are three major classes of business processes.

One is sales, the second is delivery, the third

is billing and on each class of business processes.

Under each class of business process,

there are different categories of transactions.

Inquiry is different from a quotation, which is different from an order,

which is different from how a consignment on a contract we use.

This is segregated or separated in SAP using what is called using a category.

So, we'll see some examples of where

you configure sales documents, where you configure

delivery documents, where you do billing, where you set the category, and so on.

And then, we have seen that a document type-

Is really a template

that represents the category of the business transaction and how

it should behave for example how the credit should be done

and how demand should be passed on to production and whether you know,

A status should be maintained, like hard coal versus lost or approved.

All these things are specified in a template.

And that template is called a document type.

Now, the easy part is that for all the sales templates

there is only one place where you can configure this template.

And the template looks like irrespective of the document category.

For example, if the document category is quotation

or a consignment or a contract, does not matter.

All of them have the same template and

they're all configured in the same place in SPI.

And seeing that, the

delivery, all the delivery templates irrespective of the category are

configured in a different place but another

same location in SPRO and same with Billing.

I'll show you the path that you need to take to configure this, so here

is the path where you configure the Sales document types, so o to SP Auto,

IMG,

Sales and Distribution.

Sales.

Sales document header and under that we have define sales document type.

Let me take a screenshot of this.

So, this is where you configure your sales document types.

Okay?

Sales and Distribution under SPRO.

Sales and Distribution.

Sales.

Sales Document.

Header.

And Sales Document Types.

Where do you do the delivering?

So, delivery is, are done, here.

So, go to logistics execution.

This one isn't loft so, it's an exception.

But most of this are under SD anyway.

We go to shipping.

Go to Deliveries > Delivery Types.

So, I'll take a screen shot of this as well.

So go to-

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Logistics.

Execution under SPRO, these are under SPRO,

and then shipping deliveries, delivery time.

And then how about billing?

Billing is easy.

So, you to to Billing under Sales and Distribution,

Billing Documents, Billing Document Types.

Okay, this, this, this and this, so this

is where the templates are maintained, or the document types for their respective

classes are maintained, the Billing, the Delivery and Sales.

Let's look at this example of a template.

What do we mean by a template here?

So, let's go to this section and see how this template looks like.

So, let's go to sales, sales document, sales document header, and.

Select the defined sales document type

and these are different sales document types.

So, go here and then select say.

QT for quotation, remember we have used QB

when we have done the sales documents cycle.

We can either double click it or select and go to the magnifying glass.

And here is your sales order type.

So what's the sales order type?

What is is, really?

So, this is the template that I was walking about.

You see, it has seven different sections.

Each one is a section.

This is a section that contains the number systems.

This is a section that contains some other details and this is a section that

contains billing detail, shipping details for, all

for the same sales document type call quotation.

So, this is what I mean by the template.

The template called sales document type.

All right, so this

is a template or.

A set of properties that define sales,

document type and remember the most important

property in a sales document type is the category and this is the category

and if we go back i've told you

that there are different categories of sales transactions.

These actions like inquiry, quotation, order, consignment, contract, so on.

So if you go here, this is the field or, or the property in the sales document

type, or sales document type template that shows you

what kind of category of business transaction this really.

So, can you create your own categories?

Like, if you go here, can you create your own category?

Like your own category?

No.

You can't.

These things are hard coded is SAP, meaning you can't create more than-

What is available here.

These are the only categorization that's

possible in defining a Sales document type.

That's it.

Whatever you do, you will have to confine yourself within these different

categorizations available to define and classify a Sales business process.

Now, same thing with Delivery, and same thing with [INAUDIBLE] as well.

They have a pre-defined set of categories.

And each category behaves in a certain way.

Example, a quotation behaves in a certain way and an order behaves in a certain way.

And we know how they behave based on.

The different properties we have seen when we talk about the business cycle.

Now [COUGH] if you want to create your own business process, like,

if you go to a company tomorrow to try to implement SAP, their business process

might not be anywhere similar to how software services

companies run on hardware, so this company runs or even, how a coal mine runs.

They could be totally different.

You could be working in a car rental company, implementing SAP.

You could be working in

a real estate company, implementing SAP.

Or you could be working in a production studio running SAP.

Like, there are many production companies in Hollywood that run SAP.

And

all of them have different business processes, but.

The categorization that we have seen here

is what brings structure to it.

This categorization is pretty similar, meaning when you go to

Hollywood implementing SAP for a production house, over it all.

Whether you go to a coal mine to implement SAP for their

logistic processes, there are only a fix it category of sales processes.

And if you want to create one, go and copy from

the one that closest to what you like reading.

And there are so many different categories, like quotation,

order, scheduling regiment, contract, inquiry and so on.

If you really a company is, is, is looking for an inquiry

or if customers come to this media company in Hollywood for inquiries.

You don't want to create it as a copy of coredation.

You want to start with an inquire that's provided out of the box in the CP.

Copy it, create your own,

inquiry document type.

Now this is really important.

You don't change this.

You don't go into inquiry and start changing things.

You always make it copy.

Create your own document type or template or whatever

and then start customizing it the way you want it.

Before we answer the question on why we are copying it.

We have to understand that whenever you are trying to copy it from an existing

template, make sure that you copy from the closest possible category.

Like I said, if your company is trying to implement

an inquiry business process, don't copy it from a quotation.

Are being copied from the order, don't copy

from the contract either, copy it from an inquiry.

If you are trying to create a contract, create

your own contract as a copy of a standard contract.

Now, the next important question is why do we copy?

Why can we use a standard template provided by SAP?

# 40. Copy Document Type

Previous chapter we have seen that we have to copy create our own business

document type to represent the business process that we are trying to mold.

We're trying to mold a contract we create a

new document type for contract and copy it from contract.

Now, why do we need to copy?

When not to use a standard template for [INAUDIBLE] the SAP.

After all, SAP has done so much work and research

and figured out that these are the properties of a quotation.

User why don't we just use it?

The reason is pretty simple.

[COUGH] A template is a template.

You're supposed to use a template to create your own and modify accordingly.

So here is a template

for a corporation, right.

That go here this is a template.

These are all the different sections, like, whatever sections in the template.

The template has number ranges

and general controls, some controls and so on.

These are the different sections in the standard template provided by SAP called.

The quotation now I'm saying go make your copy effort and create

your own like so, so you got quotation and this button over here.

We'll create a copy

so you use this button to copy and create you own.

So it's a specified target entries and then go here and say Z

let's say we're doing it for Hollywood.

Some productions holes in Hollywood, so Z, H, and then QT, then

Hollywood Court, and then this pops up.

[SOUND] [SOUND]

Say yes and then you

change the name here.

Right, missed that step.

So I'm gonna put back it as well, so change,

change the name to

something else 'zxxx'

and then give a description, Give Description.

And then when this pop up come us, click yes.

And then save it.

So it's gonna take some time and ask you

for what is called a customization or customizing request.

So what you've gonna do here is for now go and click on this button.

It's very similar to the way that

we have seen customization and enterprise structure right.

So over here [UNKNOWN]

click on this button and

give a description say

create H2T quote.

Send.

Right, and we get this picture.

We get this pop up again

and then click on this button.

And then will save it and then

create your custom template called Z Hollywood quotation.

Why are we going to this procedure, why not just use it as it is.

Like I said, a template is a template it suppose to be used only as a reference.

So, SAP has provided this for reference.

So, use it.

Copied and then change the properties.

There are a couple of reasons why we have to do it this way.

This is the standard SEB approach to configure any module, not just SD.

MMPP, you take any module, it's the same thing [UNKNOWN]

some configuration if you wanna use it make it copy.

Create your own and then start to modify things

that will better suit your requirements are your business processes.

You'll see some examples of changes.

But before that let me talk about another point.

For when we do this copy this the main [UNKNOWN] is [UNKNOWN] and

then I did ZHQD I didn't just do HQD for Hollywood quotation.

Right it's just four characters after all.

See?

One, two, three, four that's it that's the unique

core that identifies that sales document type in SAP.

Why did he use a Z?

Why did it start with a Z what couldn't I have just said HQT.

There's something called as Namespace.

Okay?

So, what's a Namespace?

Namespace is something that tells SAP what's the starting letter.

And there are many definitions for it, but for now let's just say

that the starting letter dictates the main space meeting, when

SAP [UNKNOWN] a new document type in the next release, say for example it currently

releases 4.7 [UNKNOWN] right?

We have different versions of Windows so let's think about Windows for a bit.

So there was Windows XP.

And then there is that was later two thousand of ninety five or whatever.

And then there is Windows Vista, and then there is Windows whatever, right?

Like say Windows 7, and then there is Windows 8 and so on, right?

These are all the different versions, versions of the software.

So similarly, SAP has many versions.

It started with: 2.0, 3.0, 3.1.

And then 4.6 and then 4.7 I really don't want to talk about

all of the [UNKNOWN] but one of the major versions is 4.7.

And then there is 5.0.

And the nee 6.0 [UNKNOWN].

Enhancement packs or so these packs like enhancement pack 1 enhancement pack 2.

So a software is, is evolutionary in

nature, right, with each enhancement or version.

SAP's gonna provide us so much more additional functionality.

And, for example, in the next release,

let's say current release is enhancement one.

And, in the next release, SAP's gonna tell us or will give us an additional piece of

functionality in the quotation, maybe a little check box

here, that makes quotation in a very different way.

Trying to encompass more business scenarios.

Or maybe SAP wants to gives us a

different quotation type, specifically for media houses in Hollywood.

So HQT.

If it happens to be HQT, one that's SAP daily words in

EHP2, then if you have created HQT as a copy of QT.

This is going to be over written and your business process stops with that upgrade,

which means when you upgrade from this to

this that you are not gonna do the upgrade.

Your system admin of SAP is going to do the upgrade that

there is going to be a whole bunch of testing and so on.

It is not something that happens out of the blue, understandable, but

when you do this upgrade and if SAP has come up with a new quotation for Hollywood

in enhancement pack two then you'll have to create

and you all should say HQ one has a copy of QT.

And use it to represent your business process.

Whereas because I said B has over and the

old business process with a starting name of Fitch.

Now, it's not fair.

Right?

Why should SAP override anything that's already configured?

You know what you're doing so why should this

enhancement of the next version override what you're doing?

It boils down to the fact that SAP is a packaged software.

It provides out of the box functionality and that's what it's good at.

It provides the functionality.

Use it if you don't want to use it make a

copy, create your own start it with a Z or a Y.

This is the only name space that's allowed for us.

And anything else starting with A B C D E F G H I J K L O [INAUDIBLE] and

then X up until X it's a B reserves the name space.

So that any enhancement that it provides as part of the

next version of the software can start with any of these alphabets.

But Y and Z are special.

They are called Customer Reserve Namespace.

What is that?

So this means that anything that starts any kind of configuration, be it document

type or whatever, that starts with a Z orY a is respected in an upgrade.

Meaning that SAP will not override.

Because SAP will not deliver them in the first place,

and that's what is the use of starting with the Y or a Z.

Now this is a little too much at this point I understand but don't worries.

As you keep doing this configuration.

Make sure that whenever you start a new

document I always start it over item category.

Any other configuration except for somethings like enterprise structure.

They're exempt because SAP does not

deliver enterprise structure elements by default.

So 1000, 3000 company codes, they're not delivered by default.

Many need SAP installation.

So you can have any numbers or anything.

You don't need to start it with a Y or Z, but

any other piece of configuration, document

type, [UNKNOWN] document types, this or that.

They all have to start with a Z or

a Y, [UNKNOWN] that's called a customer [UNKNOWN] Namespace, okay?

The second point is.

Why are we copying?

Like I said we've always got to copy from the nearest clone, right?

If you want to model a quotation, went to QT and created ZHQT quotation.

If you are working in this coal digging company and you want to create a quotation

for a coal mining company, maybe you have Z, something CQT.

And the calculus of this is going to be different from the properties of this.

What properties?

The properties could be anything that we have specified here.

Now, any of these are all, all these are properties,

and any of them could be different.

You could go change it from 70 to 80.

You could go change this from AG to CN, if it's permitted, of course.

You could go change it from five to six.

Now, I understand we have not seen these things yet.

We don't know what they are.

But these are not the different levers that control the

entire business process, so you change something the behavior changes.

That's what I mean by the nearest clone.

So when you want to create your own business process copy it

from the nearest clone, then start it with a Z or a Y.

As a matter of principle and that start changing the

properties so with this you should be able to understand.

What is a document type.

Why is it called a template?

Why you should copy and then create your

own template instead of overwriting the exiting document type.

And what is the name space that you

should be using to create your own document names.

In the next chapters we'll start exploring

the different fields inside the document type.

# 41. Number Ranges

Okay, so let's go into the configuration for the sales document type.

Go to Sbarro.

IMG.

Sales and distribution.

Sales.

Sales documents.

Sales Document Header.

Define document types.

You already know this path, so I'm not making a copy of that.

Then go here.

And select the document type that you have created, which is Hollywood quotation.

Select that.

Go inside it.

And the first thing that you see here is number ranges.

First section.

Okay, so what's a number?

Range.

A number range represents.

A sequence of numbers or an interval of numbers that that particular sales document type can have.

For example, this is Z HQ.

T, right?

That's the document type, and it has an internal number range.

Let's talk about that first.

The int over here stands for internal number Range.

And then there is an external number range

that is zero to.

First off, what is a number range?

When you create a quotation, go to VA 21.

Use the document type z h.

Q.

T.

And then put your customer in whatnot, and then you click the save button.

So you enter the details

and then you save it.

It will generate a number.

You want to see it in action.

Just open another window.

Go to v a 21.

Z, z, h, q, t, and then put some sales or distribution channel division, put your customer in

there.

And then put some material.

Put a date.

Today's date and then have the quotation be valid until, say, one week.

Then if you save it.

It's going to generate a number here, Hollywood quote.

And then it's two followed by so many zeros and then 42.

So this is the quotation number.

So you enter the details here like customer material valid to etcetera, and then you got this number.

So why did the system take this number to 000042?

Not something else.

And it has created it automatically.

You didn't ask it to use a particular number.

It has automatically taken it.

So where is it configured?

It's configured here.

So zero five refers to a number range from a starting number range under to an ending number range,

and this falls somewhere in between.

So if you want to see what's the number range associated with oh five, you got to go here and look

at what this zero five really represents.

I'm going to go back.

And look at number ranges, see number ranges for sales documents.

So select that.

Before we do that, let me take a screenshot.

So this is where number ranges are configured.

Config for number ranges.

So go back and if you want to see all the different intervals go there and zero five corresponds to

two followed by six zeros and then ends in two, four, 989 and the current number is 2000042.

Right.

So let me explain what this means.

So if you go here, this file, the number range for five starts with 20000000.

It's like 2 million or whatever.

And until 2.5 million on the current number range is 2000042.

And that's what the system has given you.

If you create another quotation now, this will become zero three.

So this is like a counter that keeps on increasing from 2 million all the way through 2.5 million.

The more quotations you create, the more numbers you consume.

This is a normal range.

And this check mark over here, if you don't check it, this is internal.

What's an internal number?

An internal number range is something that the system generates automatically within this.

Range of numbers, but if you mark it as external, that means that within this number range, the system

is not going to choose anything.

It will ask you, the user, to choose a number between this number, range, this set of numbers.

So when do you want to use external versus when do you want to use internal?

In this case, the system is giving you a privilege of using both internal as well as external.

If this is deleted, then the system defaults to external.

That's how it works.

So what's an internal number range and what's an external number range?

Internal is always system generated.

You don't have to.

Prompt or the system does not prompt you to enter a number in external, the system prompts you to enter

a number and it has to be within a number range specified in the number range interval.

If you want to create your own number range, no problem.

Just make a copy of it, call it Z1 and then you can choose a number range and you can make it either

internal or external.

So at any given time you can view the intervals, the different number range intervals.

You can go and change these intervals like you can change this to whatever as long as there is no overlap

and you can view the current status as in, you know, what's the current status, you can reset it

to any number that you want.

Like if you want to skip some numbers, that's fine.

You can go change it from 13,358 to say if you want to start with 15,000, you can make it 15,000 and

save it.

Okay, so that's a number range.

# 42. Sales Document Type Configuration - 1 

All right.

So we have just finished talking about the number ranges, internal and number ranges, external, and

we have also seen that number ranges internal takes precedence over the external number range.

All right.

Now what about these fields?

The item number increment and sub item increment.

Subitem increment is something that we can only understand when we talk about bill of materials.

So I'm going to leave it at this point.

But what about Subitem increment?

Let's try and create an order of this type and start entering materials to understand what a subitem

increments really mean.

So here is our order type zmei and we're going to start entering an order here.

Uh, so even if you put it as an external number range, right, it says that you have to enter a document

in between five, uh, six zeros and then five nine, nine nine.

One, two, three, one, two, three.

So what this goes to show you is that irrespective of whether you use internal or external, you could

still use a number range, meaning even if you want to force the users.

To enter numbers in the sales order.

Externally, you could restrict that number ranges to a particular value.

In this case, we are restricting it to zero to number range, which corresponds in N01 to a particular

number range, which is 500000 until 5999999.

All right.

Now, moving on.

We are right now testing this little feature called the item number increment.

So go here and start entering material numbers like M01M0203, so on and so forth.

Zero to any material is fine.

The point that I want to illustrate here is look at this item number increment.

It starts with ten, then 20, 30, so on and so forth.

Right.

If you started with a number range increment of, let's say 100 and let me save this guy.

Okay.

And now let's try to create an order again and see what happens here.

1000.

Then let's start entering these numbers.

M0 one.

M0 two.

Do you see the effect of this?

It says if your item number increment is X, then the items increment in that order.

So let me take a screenshot here.

So where are we?

In the previous screen we talked about item number number ranges, internal and external.

Now we are going to talk about item number increment.

An item number increment decides what should be the items that should be incremented in that particular

order, meaning items should start incrementing by 100, 200, 300, 400, and so on.

If you put it as ten, it will be ten.

If you put it as 15, it will start with 15 and then move on to 30, 45, 60.

Now, you might have a simple question here.

Why are we starting these numbers with 10 or 100 instead of 1 or 2?

Three, four, five.

Okay.

Um, most ERPs will have a facility where number ranges can be inserted in between line items.

Meaning if you have something similar to ten, 20, 30 line items and then later the customer calls

and says, you know what?

I want ten along with ten.

I want some other material.

You can put it as 40 here, or you can put it as 15, which naturally goes and sits here.

Okay, If you want, we can see that with an example.

Okay.

Now, if I say M03 and then instead of 300 or hitting enter, if I enter 150 or any number between 100

and 200, look at what happens.

See?

M03 has moved up, isn't it?

This is what I was meaning when I said number range.

Number numbers in the line.

Items always have gaps.

Like in this case we are starting with we are starting with 100, 200, 300.

And if I say if I just enter M04 here, it will automatically say 300.

But if I say M041 70, this will go and sit in between 150 and 200.

So that's a way of inserting line items in between a whole bunch of line items.

All right, that is item number increment.

So I'm going to leave subitem increment.

And when we come to Bill of Materials, I'm going to discuss that.

The next is reference mandatory.

We are moving on from number ranges and into general control.

Reference mandatory has a couple of options here.

Let's say let's pick up B, which is with reference to a quotation and then see the effect of this on

your transaction.

Okay.

Set it to be.

Save it.

Then let's start to create an order.

See me.

And then you see the system is actually forcing you to enter a quotation when I just pressed Enter.

What does this tell you?

This tells you that if you set a particular document type to be always created with reference to another

document type, let's say quotation, then you cannot create that document type without actually referring

to that quotation.

So Zee May has been configured here with option B, which says that you should mandatorily reference

a quotation and hence when you try to create an order of type Z, may, it's forcing you to enter this

quotation.

So if you say no, it doesn't take you forward.

So you're not explicitly clicking on that create with reference button.

It is forcing you to enter the create with reference button.

Sorry to enter the quotation number.

Right.

So let me delete this guy.

Okay.

The reference mandatory I'm setting it to be, which is with reference to a quotation.

When you try to create a sales order, when you try to create the May sales order.

ASAP forces you to create it with reference to a quotation.

Whatever.

Be that quotation.

Right earlier.

If you wanted to create a document or let's say an order with reference to the quotation, you had to

click on this button, right?

Remember create with reference.

But that's not the case now because we said in the configuration that we want this document type to

be always created with reference to a quotation the system is forcing us to always create with reference

to that quotation.

Now what is the business scenario that.

This, um, feel should be used under.

Let's say, for example, let me take the next go to the next page.

Let's say, for example.

Your company sells, um, some servers.

Right?

Hpcl's servers.

Right.

Big ones.

Uh, it's like 100,000.

200,000.

And when we are creating an order for a server.

In the past, we have always observed, let's say the power user of sales has always observed that,

that there has been some discrepancy that has been that the customer has asked for.

And in terms of pricing and what we have placed as an order.

So in order to avoid all this confusion, the sales people have decided, the sales team has decided

that whenever an order is created.

A approved.

Quotation is required.

Then when I say approved, somebody from the sales department or somebody in higher up in the sales

department has to look at that quotation, approve the prices, and only then the order will be created.

That way there is no way that the customer's quotation and the customer's order could be different from

each other.

Now, in this case, our order of type order, whatever will be configured in such a way that it will

be set to reference mandatory of B, whereby when somebody tries to create an order of type XXS, it

will always ask for a quotation.

All right.

This is the business example where we can use that create with reference reference mandatory field.

Okay.

For now, I'm going to make it no reference because we don't require it at this point.

And then we're going to move on to check division.

Now, this is the same field that we have seen in the enterprise structure, same org element division

as in product lines.

So here is a little, um, caveat that we have overlooked.

You look at this division.

So whenever we are trying to create an order.

Okay, let me go back because we have changed the configuration and start over again.

Whenever we are creating an order, we are entering a division.

What does that indicate?

What does that indicate?

Here again.

Once again, when you're trying to create an order, you're entering a division here.

If you don't enter a division here, at least when you select a customer master inside, you will be

forced to enter a sales org distribution channel division.

Now what is the purpose behind it?

Ideally, you wouldn't really want to or rather restrict your orders to a particular division, isn't

it?

Example if HP.

Okay, let me give you that example.

If HP is selling four divisions, laptop, desktop printer and then server.

Divisions.

Which is selling four divisions.

And when we're creating an order using VA zero one, then Enter or Z or whatever.

And then here we have sales.

Org distribution channel division.

What does this feel really say?

Are we restricting the customer to enter products only from one division?

Not necessarily.

If you want to look at an example, let's say the division that we have sorry, chosen in this case

is, you know, Z and then sales org distribution channel division is zero zero in this case.

Okay.

So in this case, the division is zero zero.

Now let's go inside and try to create an order with different line items belonging to different divisions.

Let's say M zero to.

Okay, just put your cursor on that and then hit F8.

It will take you to the material master.

What is the division here?

Zero seven.

Right.

So M02 belongs to the material zero seven Division zero seven.

And still you're able to place an order, even though you're saying initially that your division in

the sales document type should be zero zero.

That doesn't mean let's say if this is zero zero, then this is zero one and then this is ten.

This is x x.

That does not mean that the customer should only order divisions from laptop or printer or scanner.

The customer is free to choose whatever divisions you like he likes.

Okay, so here is the deviation.

This is the division in the header and this is the division in the line item.

Here is a deviation.

Normally, by default, this deviation is tolerated because we really want the customer to place orders

from any product line.

No problem.

Sometimes, however, we want to check the division and ensure.

Let's say I set it to error.

Okay.

Set it to error.

Now I go back and try and create this order.

VA01.

Now remember, the header division is 1000 zero zero.

Now I'm trying to create a division at the line item level.

For example, M02, which belongs to a different division.

And you look at the message at the bottom, it says, What does it say?

It says Division zero zero deviates from oops, sorry, deviates from.

The line items, isn't it?

So division deviates from the line item division and the header deviates from the line item.

So this.

Has resulted in.

This error.

Division at header is zero zero.

Header division is zero zero.

And item division is zero seven.

So there is this deviation and that's what SAP is trying to say here.

It says header division zero zero is deviating from item division zero seven.

Right.

That's the Czech Division field.

Moving on.

Let's remove that.

We don't want it to get in our way now.

Credit limit credit group.

We're going to discuss when we talk about credit management item division, not very important.

Read info record.

It is important, but we are going to talk about that at a later point.

Okay.

So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to highlight some of the fields and then let you know that

these are important, but we are not going to discuss at this point because we have not really gone

through some of the concepts that are really necessary in order for us to understand these things.

Okay.

So these two fields.

Learn in credit management.

It's a totally different topic and we will talk about that when we will talk about these two fields

when we get to credit management.

Now, output application, we will see in output determination.

Again, another topic that we don't care about at this point.

Don't don't rush into it.

We got time info record we will see after we learn about c, m, i, r or customer.

Material info record, which is another topic that we will discuss another day.

All right.

So these three fields are important, these four fields, but we are not going to talk about it now.

Okay, Next check.

Purchase order number.

What does this feel do?

Check.

Purchase order number.

If you check this on, then the system is going to validate.

Let's say I check this on.

Sorry.

Not this one.

This one.

Okay.

The system is going to validate whether there is a duplicate po that has been assigned that has been

created already for that particular customer.

Let me give that talk about that with an example here.

Okay, Let's say for example, customer A places like Walmart example if you remember Walmart customer

A places a purchase order of let's say PO number one, two, three, four, five.

And in VR zero one HP receives that PO and creates an order number 32146.

And in the PO number field, the system already assigns the purchase order number to the sales order

number.

So this is number.

This is PO number.

Now tomorrow if Walmart releases another PO of the same number.

Should we receive it and create an order?

Or should we call up Walmart and say, hey, you know what, you're trying to duplicate a number here.

Are you really sure these are two separate POS?

Sometimes it could be.

There could be.

Right.

You know, it it is possible.

The customer is placing another order with the same number.

An example of that kind of a scenario is called a blanket order where there will be one number against

which there will be multiple purchase orders issued, and we would have to create multiple sales orders

with the same number.

Now, if you do not want that to happen, or if that is not the case, really, then you would probably

want the system to issue an error and say, hey, duplicate PIO on the day before order number.

Da da da da da.

32145 has already been created with the same number.

Do you want to really create another one with the same number?

Right.

And in order to enable the option, set this to a.

Okay.

Set this to a.

Now, again, let's go back and try and create an order on the same document type and then for the same

customer, let's first create test PIO one.

Okay.

This is the first order.

Test.

Po is on PO.

Right.

I'm going to copy it for the customer.

1000.

Remember, if it is a different customer, the PO number could be same.

Don't, don't bother.

But if for the same customer, if the PO is going to be same, then we have a problem.

Okay.

So I'm going back and starting again with the same customer.

Right.

And try to enter a PO number here like so.

Look at the message at the bottom.

Purchase order!

Order number already exists in this document.

13334.

What it means is in that order number 13334.

You seem to have already created a PO number.

Do you really want to pursue?

Is that really right?

Right.

So this is the error message that you get, or rather a warning message when you receive duplicate POS

purchase orders.

Okay.

And that field called the check purchase order number could be used to identify whether this field is

duplicated or not.

All right, That was that.

Now enter your number.

Let's say I don't understand this field.

So you think that this field might help you in in configuring your scenario, but you don't really understand

that field?

What do you do?

So you go to this help button, select your field, highlight or focus your cursor on that field like

so, and then click on Help button or click on F1.

Now use document number to enter external port number.

So there is some help that is available here.

So SAP has chosen to provide some text as the help you can.

You can try this and make some sense out of it.

If not, you might have to really try that option out in your development environment and see the effect

of it.

But there is some help that's available against every field.

If you just highlight that field and hit on F1 or just click on this question mark button in the menu

bar in the menu.

Okay, but we don't require this.

It's not a very important field, so we're going to ignore it.

Mixed transaction flow section.

Again, not many fields are important at this point, but let me highlight whatever is important.

Quotation messages.

This is important.

This is important.

This is important.

I can say one, two, three, and then four incompletion messages.

These are important, but we are only going to talk about this field now.

The rest of the fields, one, two and four for later.

Okay.

Because in order to understand for incompletion messages, we have got to talk about incompletion log

in order to talk about one document pricing procedure, we need to understand pricing in order to understand

two status profile.

We need to understand what is the status profile and how to assign a status profile, how to set the

different statuses, so on and so forth, which are separate topics in in its own realm.

And then they require an hour of extensive study.

So we are going to revisit those fields when we come back and discuss those separate topics.

But as of now, this is a very simple field quotation messages.

What are the options that are available there?

These are the options you see right now.

It is set to be.

But these are your options.

What are the options here?

Okay.

These are your options.

And in this case, it is set to be, which means check at item level.

Okay, This is very simple.

I'm going to illustrate it with an example.

All right.

So it is said to be all right.

We're happy there.

So let's start to create an order first.

A quotation first.

Okay.

Let's say cut and then use the customer thousand.

Set a start and end date because we know that for a quotation start and end date is mandatory.

So I have put a one week as the start and end date and I enter some materials and quantities.

Okay, so one, two, three, if you like to put a number there, but that's fine.

And now save it.

So you remember for customer 1000 for material zero one, there is a quotation and that quotation number

is quotation 2000040.

Okay.

So there is an existing quotation.

Quotation for customer 1000 for material M0 one.

Now let's try and create an order here by going to VR zero one Xlm and hit enter for the same customer.

Okay, you hit enter.

You don't get any message there.

Now try M0 one and then hit enter.

Okay.

Uh.

Okay.

What is your check at item level?

Ideally, um, when we create the quotation with reference to.

Okay, Moving on.

We have shipping section and in the shipping section we will discuss delivery type delivery, block

shipping conditions and immediate delivery.

Go there and go here.

There we go.

And the important fields are.

One.

To.

# 43. Sales Document Type Configuration - 2

Three.

The first one is a delivery type.

Why do we need to enter a delivery type in a sales document type?

Now we're talking about sales document type, right?

Z or Z?

Or why are we even entering delivery document type here?

So if you remember your OTC flow, right, we've got.

Order the standard OTC flow and then delivery and then billing.

So this is F2.

So this is sales.

This is delivery.

This is billing.

In the configuration for a sales document type.

Why are we entering a delivery document type?

The reason is when you try to deliver an order type, you don't really mention the delivery document

type.

I'll tell you an example here.

Okay.

A very simple example.

When you enter an order like so, you have to enter the order type here, be it Z or Z or whatever.

All right.

Now you create your order.

Like.

So.

Okay, Now if you try to deliver an order.

All right.

Like so.

Are you really going to enter a delivery document type?

Just like the way we have entered sales document type when we created a sales order.

Now you know how to fix this problem, right?

You're going to future date it.

Right.

We never entered a delivery document type here.

Delivery is automatically created.

What type of delivery is it?

If you go to the header, this little hat kind of a button.

Okay.

And then go to administration, you'll see that the delivery document type is Lf and where is that picked

up from?

This is picked up from this button.

Or rather this field.

Okay.

The delivery document type is picked up from the shipping section of the sales document type.

So the delivery type.

And left in this case is picked up.

From shipping section.

Of the sales document type.

Okay.

This is to ensure that when you're when somebody is trying to create a delivery, they don't have to

explicitly mention the delivery document type it'll automatically picked up from.

Okay, that was that.

What about delivery block?

Let's place a delivery block.

Let's say, you know, political reasons.

Okay.

Save it.

Save it.

Let's try to create an order now via zero one.

You see the system automatically places a delivery block.

Right.

We didn't enter the delivery block.

It was automatically picked up from this particular piece of configuration.

Automatically.

Set.

You don't have to manually set it.

Why do you want to use this?

Which situation would, uh, warrant you to use this field?

For example, certain business processes.

When I mean business processes, translate that into your mind to sales document type, certain sales,

business processes.

Would always warrant you to block the document or block the process first.

Make sure certain things are in place and then explicitly release the block.

Okay.

Example could be an order type specifically for um, let's say which business process shall we pick

an order for a sales document type specifically built for, uh, samples.

Okay.

Evaluation orders or sample orders.

Now, you don't want to send out evaluations or samples to anybody and everybody you like.

You want to make sure that you send out the samples only to certain business users or certain customers

that you think are important.

Okay, so all evaluation orders, let's say Z e, v should always go on a delivery block and you customize

the delivery block in such a way that it will be some Z or something, some number that has a description,

say evaluation block and the order will automatically go on evaluation.

Block And somebody who is the right competent authority will go and remove that block and that will

be recorded in the system as the user who has removed that block.

Okay.

It's just for backtracking.

All right.

Next, we have shipping conditions.

Let me set this to 51.

Okay.

Just for the heck of it.

Some shipping conditions, 51.

Now, if I don't set those shipping conditions there, and if I try and create an order, what will

be the shipping conditions?

How do I know what the shipping conditions are?

So I go to the header, look at the shipping and see that the shipping conditions is zero two standard.

Right now let me redo this order again after having saved this.

Now let me redo this order.

Okay, now let me go to the header and see what is the shipping conditions.

You see, it has changed to 51.

Right.

What does this go to show you?

This should tell you that daily shipping conditions come from the sales document type.

Okay.

Shipping conditions come from the sales document type.

If and rather, I would say will override.

Shipping conditions from customer master.

Earlier if I did not have specified the shipping conditions here, the shipping conditions from the

customer master, which was zero two, came and sat in the shipping conditions field of the shipping

tab of that of that order.

But in this case, the shipping conditions add the line item level have overridden the shipping at from

the customer master.

A simple example again, take the evaluation order or the sample order.

By default, the customer says, Hey, you know what?

Ship me three days ground or ship me overnight.

That's my shipping preference.

So accordingly, you will set it in the Customer Masters shipping tab.

Now, if you are sending evaluation orders, you really don't want the customer to incur that overnight

shipping charges, which would be, let's say, $200 or $300 for a big equipment.

Right.

The customer would say, Why are you even sending me this evaluation overnight?

I don't need to evaluate anything overnight.

So in that case, the shipping conditions would be set to a very relaxed shipping condition, say ten

day ground or the cheapest possible so that, you know, it suits that business transaction, which

is an evaluation order which is not really a customer's priority.

We are selling goods to him and the customer.

You know, we are not even selling.

We are giving it out to try and the customer doesn't want to pay for all of the freight, isn't it?

So that is that.

And the next is immediate delivery.

Okay, So let me set this to immediate delivery, which is X.

Okay.

Or rather, a.

Okay.

Let me set this to a and try to create an order here.

First.

Okay.

Let me set this to a save it.

Okay.

You try to create an order here.

1000 as usual M011 and remove the delivery block and then click save.

You see what's going to happen here?

Look at this message.

It says May batch order number so and so has been saved.

And at the same time, the delivery has been created.

Why?

Because it has been set to a.

Okay.

Or rather, I think I did not clearly capture this.

So let me.

Okay, let me capture this here.

Oops.

Sorry.

Okay.

So this field has been set to a and this because this has been set to a the system has automatically

created a delivery without.

Having to go through zero four or VL01N any of the delivery transaction codes.

So this scenario is called a rush order.

Rush order.

What is a rush order?

Rush order is where you are forcing the system to create a delivery automatically without having to

go through either the delivery due list or the delivery creation program.

All right.

Now, when will this be useful?

Now, in the case of a rush order where the customer is waiting for the transaction to happen or meaning

customer is waiting on your front desk and saying, hey, you know what?

Release me the goods right now.

I want these goods.

I want to take them along.

Okay, Sure.

So what's going to stop the customer from taking the goods?

Well, in a standard order scenario, here is something that you should know.

In a standard scenario.

Orders will be created through the course of the day, but deliveries will not be created like that.

Deliveries will be created overnight.

Via a batch process.

This is Vl0 for it's a nightly batch process that runs once every night and takes all the deliveries

that are due for the day and creates those deliveries.

Okay, so order one night meat need not be relevant so it will not create order two is relevant.

Okay.

It will create order.

3rd May not be relevant.

Order four might be relevant.

This is the normal process.

But if the customer is waiting at your desk and asking you to rush the delivery right now, you can't

say that you know, hey, you know what?

We'll wait until the delivery process happens, which will happen overnight.

The customer will just be -- off.

Instead, what you do is you will not create a standard order like Z or or whatever other order types.

But in s you will create a rush order.

The scenario is called a rush order, which is a fancy term for configuring the document type in such

a way that your delivery will be created immediately.

As simple as that.

Okay.

This is called rush order.

And the only difference between a standard order and a rush order is that the immediate delivery flag

will be set to a.

All right.

So there you go.

That's the rush order.

The next field or section is the billing section.

So what's happening in the billing section?

Again, I'll highlight what is important delivery.

Relevant billing order.

Relevant billing in intercompany billing.

Billing Block Billing plan Type checking group.

All right.

These are our important fields now.

Five, six.

We'll see later.

Okay.

Not now.

One, two, three and four.

We'll talk about them now.

I would rather defer to talk about point number three, which is intercompany invoice, but I'll just

give you a highlight.

But later, when we come to billing document types, I'll go at a much deeper level to talk about intercompany

billing document types.

So what about the other ones?

Delivery relevant and order relevant billing type.

What really are they?

Delivery relevant billing type.

What is a delivery?

Relevant billing type delivery.

Relevant billing type means you remember it like this.

If an order has a line item ten, which is a PC and line item ten, which is a warranty or some service

item, additional service, whatever.

This can be delivered.

This cannot be delivered.

Its only a service item, so no delivery.

Now when you try to create a delivery, only ten will come through.

20 will not come through.

Now, when you try to build, what happens?

Only ten is there because this is called delivery.

Relevant billing.

Meaning when you try to create a billing document like v f0 one, you will create it with reference

to the delivery.

The other way to do it is order relevant billing, which is okay.

20 did not go through this delivery.

Neither did it go through to this invoice, but it will go in another document type or another invoice.

F2 in this case, which is the same as the order relevant, but instead it will contain 20 warranty.

So it is.

This is created with reference to order and hence it is called and it includes this line item.

Hence it is called order relevant billing.

So thumb rule here generally is a sales document type can have both service as well as delivery relevant

materials.

So for any invoice that is created with reference to delivery, relevant document types, then you use.

This document type and any invoices that you create with reference to the order directly, you use this

document type.

Okay, Now let's talk about intercompany invoice.

Intercompany.

Like I said, I'm going to briefly touch on it.

I'm not going to go through at a greater level of detail, but what is an intercompany invoice?

Very simple example that I'm going to take is us and Canada, let's say.

Okay, so here is your customer placing an order for line item ten.

And let's say this is a PC and line item 20, this is quantity 100, and then line item 20 is like,

let's say what goes along with the PC, a special monitor, a non-reflective.

Blah, blah, blah, whatever.

Right.

All right.

Now this will be delivered from the US plant.

This ideally should be delivered from the US plant.

You can see the customer is in the US somehow.

Um, when creating an order, we found out that we don't have enough stock of the special monitor and

in order to get that special monitor into stock, it's going to take ten days.

And that's what we communicate to the customer.

We say, Hey, you know what?

It's going to take ten days to get the special monitor.

Can you wait for ten days?

Customer sometimes might not like it.

So he's going to say, Hey, you know what?

I don't want to wait for ten days.

I'll place it somewhere else.

Or if you don't want to lose the customer, you can do something like this.

You can say you don't need to wait for ten days.

I have an option.

We have a plant in Canada, so I'm going to deliver it directly from Canada.

The Canadian plant, which already has the stock and will directly ship it to the customer.

So the other companies company in the sense company code, as we have learned in enterprise structure,

will ship directly to our customer.

Now, since they have shipped it directly to the customer, they will bill not the customer, but they

will bill us.

This invoice between two different company codes is called intercompany invoice.

Okay.

Intercompany invoice.

Intercompany invoices are generally generated when the delivering plant belongs to a different company

code, which is perfectly feasible because we are all part of the same parent entity and we wish to

serve our customers.

If you don't have the stock, you are going to issue the stock from a different company code.

But in order to legally and accounting wise, compensate for this, uh, sale, the other company code

is going to issue an intercompany invoice and which the customer will pay.

In this case the company which is selling to the customer.

So they will pay for the intercompany invoice.

Okay.

The customer will pay that company.

And the selling company will pay the procuring company.

This is called intercompany invoice.

Now, don't worry too much about it.

When we talk about billing document types, we're going to talk in depth or in detail about what is

an intercompany invoice.

All right, So there we go.

That's intercompany invoice and billing.

Block billing block is probably very simple.

We just place a billing block, save it.

And when you try to create an order just similar to the way an order block is created, a billing block

will be created, a delivery block will be created, a billing block will be created.

Right now, we have seen this example when we talked about sales order deepdive, isn't it?

So hope you remember that concept from there as to what a billing block does, what a delivery block

does.

Okay, so I'm not going to cover that concept again.

So here is a billing block and it automatically places a billing block here.

All right.

So that is that and checking group is something that we're not going to talk about now.

We're going to ignore it.

And same with billing plan type, because billing plan types has like milestone billing, periodical

billing, so on and so forth is something that we don't need to worry about at this point.

Okay.

Now the last field.

Lead time in days.

Okay, now look at this.

Number seven.

And look at this number here.

Okay.

Now, today's date is, what, the 15th and the requested delivery date is 29th.

Why?

Okay.

This is going to be, um, a little weird.

Because the system is adding a certain number of days and then proposing a requested delivery date.

The system is adding a certain number of days and proposing a system delivery date.

So why is it how many days is it adding?

It's adding seven days.

And those seven days or seven working days.

Okay, those seven days or seven working days.

So if you exclude your holidays or whatever that are part of your factory calendar, these lead time

in days will be added.

Added.

To current date to arrive at requested delivery date.

Now requested delivery date need not always be calculated this way.

Requested delivery date can also be calculated or rather entered based on customer's preference.

So it's basically, at the end of the day, a customer's choice as to when he wishes to receive the

goods.

If we are not able to promise or if we are not able to procure the goods at his doorstep by that date,

then we might propose an alternative date.

But otherwise the requested delivery date is based on the customer's actual request.

But if the customer did not request anything, then what the system is going to do is add a certain

number of lead to lead time in days to the current transaction.

Okay.

And then it's going to.

Produce a date that's so many days into the future.

All right.

Generally, it's going to be like, you know, these dates are Saturday and Sunday, right?

So you got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then probably there are and these are

holidays anyway.

So these are gone Saturday and Sunday.

Right.

Then maybe we got now it says 2905.

So there are two more days, maybe there were a couple of holidays in between depending on the factory

calendar or depending on the customer's calendar, depending on those parameters.

It might have excluded a number of days and then arrived at a final date of 29th.

Now, this is not set in stone.

It can always be changed to whatever date you like.

Okay.

You don't want 29, you can set it to 30th.

No problem.

Right.

It will correspondingly change all the requested, uh, schedule line dates or the available schedule

lines based on availability.

So when we discuss what is called as delivery scheduling and transportation scheduling, which is a

different topic, I will explain the role the delivery requested delivery date plays in calculating

the different milestone dates, like loading date picking, date packing date, material availability

date, so on and so forth.

Okay, that about finishes our sales document type configuration.

So go ahead, play around with all these fields.

Document category sales, document block internal number ranges, external number ranges, item number

increments, reference mandatory, so on and so forth.

And if you have questions as usual, please feel free to post in the forum.

All right.

Thank you very much.
