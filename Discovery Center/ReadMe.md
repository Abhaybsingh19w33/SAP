### Implement a simple Application
To get an introduction to SAP Build Apps, you can take a look to the first part of this starter tutorial: [Create an Application with SAP Build Apps](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appgyver-create-application.html). As you already have a running developer environment you don't need to use the Sandbox account as described in the tutorial.

### Summary
You got a first impression of SAP Build Apps. In the next step you have to choose and set up one of the following backend environments:
1. SAP S/4HANA Cloud 
2. SAP S/4HANA on-premise
3. Mock Server
