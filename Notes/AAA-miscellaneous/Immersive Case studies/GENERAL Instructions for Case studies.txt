To be done before starting
1. Refer to the standard tables - Structure, Data
2. Uunderstand the relationship between tables- Key fields

Object(Table/View/Pgm/FM/Include) naming convention
Eg Table
ZEMPCODETABNAME
EG. Z4607899MARA,Z4607899MARC,Z4607899MAKT
Package Name 
Z4607899Sprint

1) Create user defined Domains and Data elements for key field in the table.
2) Refer to standard table for the Data type of the Domains/Data Elements.
3) Use  predefined Domains and predefined Data Elements for non key fields.
4) Make use of FOR ALL ENTRIES instead of JOINS in reports
5) Use includes
6) If the case study has only report, please make classical ALV also.
7) Use Pretty printer. Key words UpperCase/All report upper case
8) Check SY-SUBRC after relevent statements e.g (Read/select/insert/update/delete)
9) Make the program modular.
10) Give appropriate field headings Not VBELN/FKART which are DB field headings in all reports(Classical/Interactive/ ALV / Smart form/ Adobe Form)
11) Give names to Parameters/Select Options. Eg Parameter Labels
13) Ensure that best practices are followed
12) Always ensure that program is indented.
9) Avoid nested ifs. Use Subroutines
If cond.
   If cond
      stmt1
      stmt2
   else
      stmt3.
   endif.
else
  stmt4.
endif. 

Instead of above, do as below
If cond.
  perform sub1.
else
  stmt4.
endif.       

form sub1.
 If cond
      stmt1
      stmt2
   else
      stmt3.
   endif.
endform.
