*Conversion exit ALPHA, external->internal
*
*ALPHA conversion is often used with account numbers.
*In conversions from the external to the internal format, the system checks to see whether input in the INPUT field is purely numeric
*(that is, if this input consists only of numbers, possibly with spaces before and after them).
*If this is the case, then the number string is inserted right-justified in the display field OUTPUT and all spaces to the left of the value are filled with zeros ('0').

*If the input is not purely numeric, it is inserted in the display field from left to right and all extra spaces are filled with blanks.
*
*Examples: (Input field and output field are both eight characters in length)
*
*1. '1234    ' --> '00001234'
*2. 'ABCD    ' --> 'ABCD    '
*3. ' 1234   ' --> '00001234'
